Programs by HackerOne, Google, Facebook, Mozilla, Github, and others have helped to create a strong bug-hunting community.\r\n\r\nHere at BrickFTP, we celebrate security and we encourage independent security researchers to help us keep our products secure. We offer a Security Bug Bounty Program (the \"Program\") to create an incentive and reward structure so that researchers are able to devote resources to working on BrickFTP.\r\n\r\nWe will pay $100 to $1,000, at our discretion, to any researcher who discovers a significant security vulnerability in BrickFTP. We pay quickly and fairly, every time, as long as you follow our rules.\r\n\r\nIf you've found a vulnerability or would like to perform security research against BrickFTP, please read through the rules below.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Reports We Are Looking For\r\n\r\nWe want to know about anything about our platform that poses a significant security vulnerability to either us or our customers.\r\n\r\nThese can include:\r\n\r\n* Privilege Escalation\r\n* Authentication Bypass\r\n* Leakage of Sensitive Data\r\n* Remote Code Execution\r\n* SQL Injection\r\n* Cross-Site Request Forgery (XSRF)\r\n* Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)\r\n* Code Injection\r\n\r\n\r\n## Bug Bounty Program Requirements\r\n\r\nTo participate in our program, you must create trial account on our platform by navigating to BrickFTP.com and clicking the button to start a Free Trial. Your account must include the phrase \"[BUGBOUNTY]\" in the \"Site Name\" used when registering. (Without quotes, but with square brackets.)\r\n\r\n* Do not create more than one trial account within a 60-day period for the purpose of conducting security research against our platform.\r\n* Do not attempt to gain access to another user's account or data.\r\n* Do not impact other users with your testing.\r\n* Do not perform any attack that could harm the reliability/integrity of our services or data. DDoS/spam attacks are not allowed.\r\n* Do not publicly disclose a bug either before or after it has been fixed. Public disclosure means disclosure to anyone, even on private \"Hacker\" websites and forums.\r\n* Do not attempt non-technical attacks such as social engineering, phishing, or physical attacks against our employees, users, or infrastructure.\r\n* Do not upload information about the vulnerability to any site you do not directly own. This includes uploading videos to YouTube, Vimeo, etc, even if marked private.\r\n* Any scanners or automated tools used to find vulnerabilities need to be rate limited.\r\n* Decisions made by us regarding the eligibility of submissions are final. Do not write back to dispute a decision.\r\n* You are expected to be 100% professional and pleasant to work with via E-Mail.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Reports That Do Not Qualify\r\n\r\nThe following types of reports do not qualify and will not pay a bounty.\r\n\r\n* Vulnerabilities that do not grant any additional ability or privileges beyond normal BrickFTP features.\r\n* Vulnerabilities on the BrickFTP.com marketing website or support website, unless they lead to a vulnerability on the actual BrickFTP platform.\r\n* Vulnerabilities that only affect outdated or unpatched browser/plugin versions.\r\n* Vulnerabilities requiring exceedingly unlikely user interaction.\r\n* Vulnerabilities, such as timing attacks, that prove the existence of a user or site.\r\n* Vulnerabilities requiring social or physical attacks.\r\n* Reports related to denial of service attacks or DNSsec.\r\n* Insecure cookie settings for non-sensitive cookies.\r\n* Disclosure of public information and information that does not present significant risk.\r\n* Vulnerabilities that have already been submitted by another user, that we are already aware of, or that have been classified as ineligible.\r\n* Scripting or other automation and brute forcing of intended functionality.\r\n* Issues that we can't understand or reproduce.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Commonly False Positive Reports\r\n\r\n* BrickFTP is an FTP, SFTP, and WebDAV hosting service. Obviously this means that we will have an open FTP server on port 21, SFTP on port 22, and it means that our servers respond to DAV verbs.\r\n\r\nReporting any of the above false positives shall result in your being blacklisted from the Program.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Important Terms\r\n\r\nWe aim to pay bounties as quickly as possible and will pay bounties sometimes before the issue is patched. Therefore, we require that you do not disclose any vulnerability publicly, either before or after the bounty is paid.\r\n\r\nIf paid a bounty, you may disclose that you received a bounty, but you may not disclose the amount or any information related to the type of vulnerability you found. Under no other circumstances may you disclose anything about your participation in this program.\r\n\r\nYou are still bound by the Terms of Service you agreed to upon signup for your Trial account. Please read and understand this document as it affects your rights.\r\n\r\nBrickFTP's submission rules under HackerOne DIFFER SLIGHTLY from the rules for its Bounty program posted on its website.  They are modified to the least extent possible to be compatible with HackerOne's rules.  If you participate via Hackerone, you will be bound by these rules.  If you participate via our website, you will be bound by the rules posted there.\r\n\r\n\r\n## To Report a Vulnerability\r\n\r\nTo report a vulnerability via Hackerone, first re-read this entire page to be sure that you understand the terms. A single violation of the terms set forth on this page will lead to an immediate revocation of your access to the Bug Bounty program and we will not pay any bounties to anyone who has violated any of the terms on this page.\r\n\r\nSubmissions in violation of the terms will not be eligible for the Program, however, we will obviously evaluate them anyway and we reserve the right to act on their recommendations without notice to the submitter.\r\n\r\nIf your submission is in compliance with our rules, we will respond as quickly as possible to your submission.\r\n\r\nIf you do not receive a response within 48 hours and you are absolutely certain that you are in 100% compliance with these rules, please write to us again to check on the status of your submission.","policy_html":"\u003cp\u003eSoftware security researchers are increasingly engaging with Internet companies to hunt down vulnerabilities.

We are committed to the pursuit of collaborative effort with this community to improve our security and we wish to acknowledge and recognize those who have made an effort to improve our security. If you believe you've discovered a security issue within our guidelines, we encourage you to report the issue to us. \r\n\r\n## Scope\r\nThe scope of this program is limited to technical vulnerabilities on FormAssembly related applications and services under the following domains:\r\n\r\n* *.formassembly.com\r\n* *.tfaforms.com\r\n\r\nTesting is **prohibited** for the following hostname patterns:\r\n\r\n* *.tfaforms.net\r\n* formassembly.disqus.com\r\n\r\nAny reports including these domains will be automatically rejected and the user will be subject to permanent disqualification from this program.\r\n\r\nNo testing is permitted against production enterprise resources, regardless of hostname. To test our enterprise application, please use **enterprisedemo.formassembly.com** as the target. You may login to this application as the administrative user `demo` with the password `demo`. \r\n\r\n## Disclosure Eligibility\r\nTo participate in the FormAssembly disclosure program, you must be the first person to responsibly disclose a previously unknown issue. Our staff will assess each report to determine if it is an eligible disclosure. We strive for a quick response, but we will respond to your report within 30 days. Additionally, we will request up to 90 days to implement a fix depending on the severity and complexity of the report. \r\n\r\nImplementing a fix is not the same as releasing a fix. The release of a fix will be determined based upon the severity and complexity of the disclosure. Due to the complexity of deployments at FormAssembly, a release may not occur within the 90 day window. We will keep you updated during this process. \r\n\r\nWe also believe that 30 day response, 90 day resolution timeline is a reasonable timeline to govern our process. Please allow for this process to complete before publicly disclosing the vulnerability or contents of the report. Public disclosure prior to completion of this process will result in disqualification of your report. \r\n\r\nSubject the exclusions below, we appreciate issues related to the FormAssembly infrastructure, FormAssembly user data, FormAssembly application, including, but not limited to: \r\n* Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF/XSRF)\r\n* Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)\r\n* Authentication Vulnerabilities (including OAuth, SSO)\r\n* Privilege Escalation \r\n* Session Management\r\n* SQL Injection \r\n* Remote Code Execution\r\n* Information Disclosure, including Sensitive Data\r\n* Content Spoofing\r\n* Configuration\r\n\r\nAll reports must contain data to ensure compliance with the disclosure program. We may request additional information to ensure compliance, such as IP address associated with the testing, user accounts created to perform testing, approximate timestamps of testing, and other information related to your testing process. You can help expedite the review process by providing this information in your initial report. \r\n\r\nAs a general rule, providing as much relevant information in the disclosure will ensure an expedited response. We recommend that you describe the risk identified, justify your submission and its alleged severity, provide a proof of concept, and any other relevant information. \r\n\r\nPlease do not upload files in an archive format. Upload files individually. \r\n\r\n## General Exclusions\r\nWhile we will consider submissions involving the following categories, we will not accept disclosures for each unless the disclosure is noteworthy in terms of technical implementation, creativity, severity, or other relevant criteria.\r\n\r\n* Strict-Transport-Security Issues. We are aware, but are not enabling it yet. \r\n* Clickjacking.

While we appreciate the advice, general advice without substantiation or relevance to our resources does not qualify.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Absolute Exclusions\r\nThe following conditions are absolutely excluded from this disclosure program. Any submissions of these excluded categories will result in permanent disqualification.\r\n\r\n* Any testing performed against any production FormAssembly Enterprise instances.\r\n* Any vulnerability obtained through the compromise of FormAssembly user or FormAssembly employee accounts. If you need to test a vulnerability, create account(s).\r\n* Testing with automated tools.

Additionally, we will request up to 90 days to implement a fix depending on the severity and complexity of the report. \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eImplementing a fix is not the same as releasing a fix. The release of a fix will be determined based upon the severity and complexity of the disclosure.

We will keep you updated during this process. \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eWe also believe that 30 day response, 90 day resolution timeline is a reasonable timeline to govern our process.

Currently, in the context of the HackerOne program, Nintendo is only interested in vulnerability information regarding the Nintendo Switch™ system and the Nintendo 3DS™ family of systems and is not seeking vulnerability information regarding other Nintendo platforms, network service, or server-related information.  \r\n\r\nBelow are examples of types of activities that Nintendo is focused on preventing:\r\n* Piracy, including:\r\n       * Game application dumping\r\n       * Copied game application execution\r\n* Cheating, including:\r\n       * Game application modification\r\n       * Save data modification\r\n* Dissemination of inappropriate content to children\r\n\r\nBelow are examples of vulnerabilities that Nintendo is interested in receiving information about:\r\n* System vulnerabilities regarding Nintendo Switch\r\n       * Privilege escalation from userland\r\n       * Kernel takeover\r\n       * ARM® TrustZone® takeover\r\n* Vulnerabilities regarding Nintendo-published applications for Nintendo Switch\r\n       * Userland takeover\r\n* System vulnerabilities regarding the Nintendo 3DS family of systems\r\n - Privilege escalation on ARM® ARM11™ userland\r\n - ARM11 kernel takeover\r\n - ARM® ARM9™ userland takeover\r\n - ARM9 kernel takeover\r\n- Vulnerabilities regarding Nintendo-published applications for the Nintendo 3DS family of systems\r\n - ARM11 userland takeover that doesn't require other hacks or tools (\"secondary\" exploits would be those that require other hacks or tools to be effective; those would be out of scope for this program) \r\n - Hardware vulnerabilities regarding either the Nintendo Switch system or the Nintendo 3DS™ family of systems\r\n- Low-cost cloning\r\n- Security key detection via information leaks\r\n\r\nNintendo reserves the right to choose whether or not it will address any reported vulnerabilities.\r\nARM and TrustZone are registered trademarks of ARM Limited (or its subsidiaries) in the EU and/or elsewhere.

Only one reward per qualifying piece of vulnerability information will be awarded.  Nintendo will determine at its discretion whether the vulnerability information qualifies for a reward as well as the amount of any such reward. Nintendo does not disclose how the reward amount is calculated. Vulnerability information that is already known to Nintendo or the public, for example, does not qualify for a reward.  Rewards will not be issued to individuals who are on sanction lists, or who are in countries on sanction lists.  \r\n\r\nThe reward amount depends on the importance of the information and the quality of the report. In general, the importance of the information is higher if the vulnerability is severe, easy-to-exploit, etc.\r\n\r\nA report is evaluated to be high quality if you show that the vulnerability is exploitable by providing a proof of concept (functional exploit code is even better). If you don’t yet have a proof of concept, or functional exploit code, we still encourage you to report to us sooner rather than later such that you do not to lose the opportunity to become the first reporter; you can then submit a proof of concept or functional exploit code later (within three (3) weeks of the initial report) and it will be considered to be a part of the report. \r\n\r\nThe reward will be paid after the reported vulnerability has been fixed by Nintendo, but no later than four (4) months after Nintendo has confirmed the reported vulnerability.\r\n\r\nNintendo will not disclose to the public the amount of any reward distributed by Nintendo.\r\n\r\n# Disclosure of vulnerability information\r\n\r\nBecause older system versions can continue to exploit vulnerabilities that have been reported to Nintendo by researchers and subsequently fixed by Nintendo, you agree that you shall not disclose vulnerability information reported to Nintendo to any other third party.\r\n\r\n# Report template\r\n\r\nPlease include the details requested below when submitting vulnerability information to Nintendo. All such reports should be submitted in English.\r\n- State the name of the applicable platform (e.g., Nintendo Switch, Nintendo 3DS, or New Nintendo 3DS)\r\n- State the region you used (e.g., JP, US, or EU) if the platform is Nintendo 3DS or New Nintendo 3DS\r\n- State the system version number(s) that the vulnerability applies to\r\n- Describe all of the steps required to reproduce the issue\r\n- Describe the details of what the vulnerability is and, if possible, potential ways to fix the vulnerability\r\n- Describe, if applicable, how individuals might be able to utilize the vulnerability information to impair the applicable system(s) and/or game(s) by showing a proof of concept or functional exploit code.

The Robinhood platform allows individuals to invest in publicly traded companies and exchange-traded funds listed on U.S. exchanges without paying a commission. We believe that exceptionally engineered systems are the cornerstones of establishing trust and recognize the importance of security researchers in helping us keep our platform safe. We encourage responsible disclosure of security vulnerabilities and will award bounties commensurate with the severity of the issue.\r\n\r\n## Responsible Disclosure\r\nIf you are able to execute an attack and gain access to our systems, accounts, or any other type of sensitive data, we ask that you __make every effort to not leak data or damage the integrity of our systems__ and report the issue privately to us via this program. Specifically, this means:\r\n* Provide us with a reasonable amount of time to fix the issue before publishing it elsewhere.\r\n* Provide us with details (code, endpoints, etc) of the vulnerability so we can find and fix it.\r\n* Do not leak, tamper, or destroy any Robinhood data.\r\n* Do not defraud Robinhood users or Robinhood itself (by making fraudulent transactions).\r\n* Do not create a large number of user accounts or fake data records.\r\n\r\n### Special Considerations\r\nDue to the nature of our business, we ask that you also follow these guidelines:\r\n* __Do not perform tests against our system around when the stock market is open (Mon-Fri, 9AM - 4:30PM US/Eastern) which could result in downtime for our services.__\r\n* __Do not make financial transactions (money transfers, stock trades, etc) with compromised user account(s).__\r\n\r\n## Scope\r\nRobinhood maintains the following services which are within the scope of this program:\r\n* Website (https://www.robinhood.com)\r\n* API (https://api.robinhood.com)\r\n* iOS and Android apps (available in their respective app stores)\r\n\r\nThe following are security vulnerabilities which would be relevant for us if they exist:\r\n* Authentication bypass or privilege escalation\r\n* Remote code execution\r\n* Sensitive data leakage\r\n* SQL injections\r\n* Accounting errors\r\n* XSS/CSRF/click-jacking\r\n* Denial of service not relating to a distributed attack\r\n\r\n## Out of scope\r\nThe following issues are outside the scope of this program and should not be attempted:\r\n* No physical attacks against Robinhood employees, offices, or data centers.\r\n* No social engineering of Robinhood employees or users (phishing).\r\n* No DDoS (SYN floods, Slowloris attacks, etc)\r\n* 3rd-party API integrations with our services.\r\n* Vulnerabilities that are strictly client-side or require physical or malicious access to the user's device.\r\n* Our blog (http://blog.robinhood.com) or presences on social media (Facebook, Twitter, etc).\r\n\r\n## Signal to Noise\r\nThe following issues are ambiguous in nature and should be carefully considered before a report is filed:\r\n* Missing best practices which don't lead to a vulnerability (automated scanners tend to report these)\r\n* Missing security headers (`X-XSS-Protection`, `X-Content-Type-Options`, `X-Frame-Options`, etc)\r\n* Missing CSRF tokens which don't affect the security of the application\r\n* SSL/TLS issues (renegotiation DoS, cipher suites, etc) unless you can demonstrate a practical attack\r\n* Brute force attacks against user chosen passwords\r\n* Throttling rate limits on endpoints which do not require it\r\n\r\nIn general, reports for these issues should demonstrate practical method(s) for exploitation. Otherwise, these reports will be closed as non-applicable.\r\n\r\n## Rewards\r\nThe minimum payout is $100 USD for reporting a previously unknown security vulnerability of sufficient severity and higher amounts will be awarded commensurate with the severity of the vulnerability.

This is an intentional design decision to enable sharing (the ability to view someone's invoice without being given the link would be considered a serious vulnerability)\r\n- Plug 'n Hack discloses the port the proxy is listening on by design\r\n- Changing the proxy settings to listen on a non-loopback IP exposes the web interface to people with network access by design.\r\n\r\nSome other caveats:\r\n- The Paypal price can be tampered with but underpayment will result in product non-delivery so this isn't a security issue.\r\n- We use Content-Security-Policy (CSP) site-wide. This means you will have a hard time doing alert(1). We pay for HTML/JavaScript injection regardless but to maximize your payout, see if you can make a payload that will steal some sensitive information.\r\n- As the makers of Burp Suite, we can assure you that we have already scanned our website with it. Don't waste your bandwidth.\r\n- Extensions including those in the BApp Store are out of scope. We highly recommend disabling all extensions before testing Burp, to save yourself from wasting time.\r\n\r\nWhat constitutes a vulnerability in Burp Suite?\r\n--\r\nThe system that Burp Suite runs on is trusted, and every system that can access the Proxy listener is trusted to access the data within Burp. Extensions, configuration files and project files are also trusted. Websites accessed through Burp are untrusted, so anything a website could do to read files off the user's computer, read data out of Burp Suite, or gain remote code execution would be considered a vulnerability. Also, any way to get someone else's Collaborator interactions would be considered a vulnerability. Burp doesn't enforce upstream SSL trust by design, so we're not currently concerned about issues like weak SSL ciphers that would be considered a vulnerability in a web browser. Detection of Burp usage, denial of service vulnerabilities, and license enforcement/obfuscation issues are all out of scope. Please refer to the payout guidelines for some example vulnerabilities.\r\n\r\nContact\r\n--\r\nIf you have any questions, you can contact us at support@portswigger.net\r\n\r\nGood luck and have fun!","policy_html":"\u003ch2 id=\"scope\"\u003eScope\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eWebsite: \u003ca title=\"https://portswigger.net/\" href=\"https://portswigger.net/\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\"\u003e\u003cspan\u003ehttps://portswigger.net/\u003c/span\u003e\u003ci class=\"icon-external-link\"\u003e\u003c/i\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eSoftware: Burp Suite Professional and Burp Suite Free Edition\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eAll subdomains of portswigger.net are \u003cstrong\u003estrictly out of scope\u003c/strong\u003e.

Extensions, configuration files and project files are also trusted. Websites accessed through Burp are untrusted, so anything a website could do to read files off the user\u0026#39;s computer, read data out of Burp Suite, or gain remote code execution would be considered a vulnerability. Also, any way to get someone else\u0026#39;s Collaborator interactions would be considered a vulnerability. Burp doesn\u0026#39;t enforce upstream SSL trust by design, so we\u0026#39;re not currently concerned about issues like weak SSL ciphers that would be considered a vulnerability in a web browser. Detection of Burp usage, denial of service vulnerabilities, and license enforcement/obfuscation issues are all out of scope.

Our information technologies provide critical services to Military Service members, their families, and DoD employees and contractors. Ultimately, our network security ensures that we can accomplish our missions and defend the United States of America.\r\n\r\nThe security researcher community regularly makes valuable contributions to the security of organizations and the broader Internet, and DoD recognizes that fostering a close relationship with the community will help improve our own security. So if you have information about a vulnerability in a DoD website or web application, we want to hear from you!\r\n\r\nInformation submitted to DoD under this policy will be used for defensive purposes – to mitigate or remediate vulnerabilities in our networks or applications, or the applications of our vendors.\r\n\r\nThis is DoD’s initial effort to create a positive feedback loop between researchers and DoD – please be patient as we refine and update the process.\r\n\r\nPlease review, understand, and agree to the following terms and conditions before conducting any testing of DoD networks and before submitting a report. Thank you. \r\n\r\n## Scope\r\nAny public-facing website owned, operated, or controlled by DoD, including web applications hosted on those sites.¹\r\n\r\n## How to Submit a Report  \t\r\nPlease provide a detailed summary of the vulnerability, including: type of issue; product, version, and configuration of software containing the bug; step-by-step instructions to reproduce the issue; proof-of-concept; impact of the issue; and suggested mitigation or remediation actions, as appropriate.\r\n\r\nBy clicking “Submit Report,” you are indicating that you have read, understand, and agree to the guidelines described in this policy for the conduct of security research and disclosure of vulnerabilities or indicators of vulnerabilities related to DoD information systems, and consent to having the contents of the communication and follow-up communications stored on a U.S. Government information system.\r\n\r\n## Guidelines\r\nDoD will deal in good faith with researchers who discover, test, and submit vulnerabilities² or indicators of vulnerabilities in accordance with these guidelines:\r\n* Your activities are limited exclusively to –\r\n * (1) Testing to detect a vulnerability or identify an indicator related to a vulnerability;³ or \r\n * (2) Sharing with, or receiving from, DoD information about a vulnerability or an indicator related to a vulnerability. \r\n* You do no harm and do not exploit any vulnerability beyond the minimal amount of testing required to prove that a vulnerability exists or to identify an indicator related to a vulnerability.\r\n* You avoid intentionally accessing the content of any communications, data, or information transiting or stored on DoD information system(s) – except to the extent that the information is directly related to a vulnerability and the access is necessary to prove that the vulnerability exists. \r\n* You do not exfiltrate any data under any circumstances. \r\n* You do not intentionally compromise the privacy or safety of DoD personnel (e.g. civilian employees or military members), or any third parties.\r\n* You do not intentionally compromise the intellectual property or other commercial or financial interests of any DoD personnel or entities, or any third parties.\r\n* You do not publicly disclose any details of the vulnerability, indicator of vulnerability, or the content of information rendered available by a vulnerability, except upon receiving explicit written authorization from DoD.\r\n* You do not conduct denial of service testing.\r\n* You do not conduct social engineering, including spear phishing, of DoD personnel or contractors.   \r\n* You do not submit a high-volume of low-quality reports.\r\n* If at any point you are uncertain whether to continue testing, please engage with our team.\r\n\r\n## What You Can Expect From Us\r\nWe take every disclosure seriously and very much appreciate the efforts of security researchers.  We will investigate every disclosure and strive to ensure that appropriate steps are taken to mitigate risk and remediate reported vulnerabilities.\r\n\r\nDoD has a unique information and communications technology footprint that is tightly interwoven and globally deployed. Many DoD technologies are deployed in combat zones and, to varying degrees, support ongoing military operations; the proper functioning of DoD systems and applications can have a life-or-death impact on Service members and international allies and partners of the United States. DoD must take extra care while investigating the impact of vulnerabilities and providing a fix, so we ask your patience during this period.\r\n\r\nDoD remains committed to coordinating with the researcher as openly and quickly as possible. This includes:\r\n\r\n* Within three business days, we will acknowledge receipt of your report. DoD’s security team will investigate the report and may contact you for further information.\r\n* To the best of our ability, we will confirm the existence of the vulnerability to the researcher and keep the researcher informed, as appropriate, as remediation of the vulnerability is underway.\r\n* We want researchers to be recognized publicly for their contributions, if that is the researcher’s desire. We will seek to allow researchers to be publicly recognized whenever possible. However, public disclosure of vulnerabilities will only be authorized at the express written consent of DoD.\r\n\r\nInformation submitted to DoD under this policy will be used for defensive purposes – to mitigate or remediate vulnerabilities in our networks or applications, or the applications of our vendors.\r\n\r\n## Legal\r\nYou must comply with all applicable Federal, State, and local laws in connection with your security research activities or other participation in this vulnerability disclosure program.\r\n\r\nDoD does not authorize, permit, or otherwise allow (expressly or impliedly) any person, including any individual, group of individuals, consortium, partnership, or any other business or legal entity to engage in any security research or vulnerability or threat disclosure activity that is inconsistent with this policy or the law.  If you engage in any activities that are inconsistent with this policy or the law, you may be subject to criminal and/or civil liabilities.\r\n\r\nTo the extent that any security research or vulnerability disclosure activity involves the networks, systems, information, applications, products, or services of a non-DoD entity (e.g., other Federal departments or agencies; State, local, or tribal governments; private sector companies or persons; employees or personnel of any such entities; or any other such third party), that non-DoD third party may independently determine whether to pursue legal action or remedies related to such activities.\r\n\r\nIf you conduct your security research and vulnerability disclosure activities in accordance with the restrictions and guidelines set forth in this policy, (1) DoD will not initiate or recommend any law enforcement or civil lawsuits related to such activities, and (2) in the event of any law enforcement or civil action brought by anyone other than DoD, DoD will take steps to make known that your activities were conducted pursuant to and in compliance with this policy. \r\n\r\nDoD may modify the terms of this policy or terminate the policy at any time. \r\n\r\n----\r\n\r\n¹ These websites constitute “information systems” as defined by 6 U.S.C. 1501(9)).\r\n² Vulnerabilities throughout this policy may be considered “security vulnerabilities” as defined by 6 U.S.C. 1501(17)\r\n³ These activities, if applied consistent with the terms of this policy, constitute “defensive measures” as defined by 6 U.S.C. 1501(7)).

If it's a security issue with the Ruby on Rails framework, see the [Rails Security guide](http://rubyonrails.org/security/).\r\n\r\nFor any security bug or issue with the RubyGems client or RubyGems.org service, please let us know here with details about the problem.\r\n\r\nPlease note: the [rubygems-developers mailing list](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/rubygems-developers), the [rubygems.org mailing list](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/rubygems-org), and the #rubygems IRC channel are public areas.

Security report received and is assigned a primary handler. This person will coordinate the fix and release process.\r\n2. Problem is confirmed and, a list of all affected versions is determined. Code is audited to find any potential similar problems.\r\n3. Fixes are prepared for all releases which are still supported. These fixes are not committed to the public repository but rather held locally pending the announcement.\r\n4. A suggested embargo date for this vulnerability is chosen.\r\n5. On the embargo date, the [rubygems-developers mailing list](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/rubygems-developers) is sent an announcement. This will include patches for all versions still under support. The changes are pushed to the public repository and new gems released to rubygems. At least 6 hours after the mailing list is notified, a copy of the advisory will be published on the [RubyGems.org blog](http://blog.rubygems.org/).\r\n\r\nThis process can take some time, especially when coordination is required with maintainers of other projects.

We regret that we cannot make exceptions to this policy for high traffic or important sites, as any disclosure beyond the minimum required to coordinate a fix could cause an early leak of the vulnerability.\r\n\r\n# Internet Bug Bounty Qualification\r\nFor bounty rewards, only the [rubygems library](https://github.com/rubygems/rubygems) is in scope. Also, only critical vulnerabilities that demonstrate complete compromise of the system's integrity or confidentiality are eligible for a bounty - typically **Arbitrary Code Execution** or equivalent impact. While we encourage you to submit all potential issues, lower severity issues are not in scope for the bounty at this time.\r\n\r\n| Impact | Amount |\r\n| --- | --- |\r\n| **High** *Demonstrate that remote exploitation of this bug can be easily, actively, and reliably achieved.* | $1,500+ |\r\n| **Medium** *Demonstrate that remote exploitation of this bug is very likely (e.g. good control a register).* | $1,000 |\r\n| **Minimum** *Demonstrate the presence of a security bug with probable remote exploitation potential.* | $500 |\r\n\r\nThe project maintainers have final decision on which issues constitute security vulnerabilities.

We will investigate all legitimate reports and do our best to quickly fix the problem. However, some of our products are in beta, so we do expect a large volume of changes in our code and may already be aware of the issue. If you submit a report for a known issue, we will do our best to let you know quickly so you can move on.\r\n\r\n##Rules\r\nIn the words of Cesar Millan: \"no talk, no touch, no eye contact\". Basically, use good judgment (except as outlined below in \"Destructive/Invasive Attacks\").\r\n* Clearly identify your account by adding something like \"H1\", \"attacker\", \"hacker\", \"test\", etc. to your name so we don't terminate your account when we see suspicious activity.\r\n* Do not destroy or degrade the performance of our products and services, or violate the privacy and integrity of user accounts and data. \r\n* To be clear, you must *never* attempt to view, modify, or damage data belonging to others in production (though, we encourage these attempts in our non-production environment).\r\n* Do not interact with other users without their prior consent.\r\n* Do not attempt a denial-of-service attack on our production environment (legalrobot.com).\r\n* Do not perform any research or testing in violation of law.\r\n\r\nAs long as your research stays within the bounds of the criteria in this policy, we welcome the dialogue and promise not to take legal action.\r\n\r\n## Report Focus \u0026 Tips\r\nWe are particularly interested in problems that allow unauthorized access to other user's documents and will award monetary bounties accordingly. However, YOU MUST ONLY ATTEMPT THIS IN OUR NON-PRODUCTION ENVIRONMENT (legalrobot-uat.com).\r\n\r\nOur www subdomain only hosts static, non-sensitive content like our blog and marketing pages, so many attacks against this subdomain are unlikely to result in a bounty. We suggest that you focus your efforts on our app subdomain.\r\n\r\nWe proudly use [Stripe](https://stripe.com) as our payment processor. To simulate a payment and gain access to a paid-only section of our app, we suggest you work in our non-production environment (legalrobot-uat.com) and check out the [Stripe testing documentation](https://stripe.com/docs/testing) which has test credit card numbers.\r\n\r\nIf you accidentally perform a live transaction, just let us know at hello@legalrobot.com and we'll make things right. Security researchers that dispute a live transaction will be immediately banned from our HackerOne program and will no longer be exempted from legal action. We may take further action outside of this policy (but always in accordance with our [terms of service](https://www.legalrobot.com/terms/)).\r\n\r\n##Destructive/Invasive Attacks\r\nWe provide a non-production environment (legalrobot-uat.com) that you may use for destructive and invasive attacks. All of the data in this environment is non-sensitive, so have at it... just DO NOT do anything illegal, or launch an extended denial-of-service or similar attack that could disrupt or get us blacklisted with our service providers (keep any DoS attempts short... like, under a few minutes). Because legalrobot-uat.com is not a full production environment, DMARC, SPF, and similar email issues will not be eligible. To be clear, issues that exist on the legalrobot-uat.com domain but not on legalrobot.com will not be accepted.\r\n\r\n##Ineligible Reports\r\n* Reports from automated tools or scans\r\n* Already public issues related to software, scripts, or protocols not under our control (e.g. meteor.js, node.js, cordova, etc)... unless we are using a version that is seriously out of date\r\n* Security issues in 3rd party components (Disqus, Intercom, Stripe), unless they present a unique threat to our service. Usually, these issues should be reported to the company that makes the component. We're more than happy to hear about these issues, but they will not be eligible for a bounty (reputation only).\r\n* Use of a known-vulnerable library without evidence of exploitability\r\n* Disclosure of software version, server IP, or other non-sensitive information. We're happy to accept reports on this, but reports will be closed as informative without a demonstration of an exploit using the information.\r\n* Attacks requiring physical access to a user's device or network\r\n* Attacks that require attacker app to have the permission to overlay on top of our app (e.g., tapjacking)\r\n* Any access to data where the targeted user needs to be operating a rooted mobile device\r\n* Vulnerabilities affecting users of outdated browsers, platforms, or crypto (i.e. TLS BEAST, POODLE, etc)\r\n* Social engineering of our staff or contractors, phishing, spear phishing, etc.\r\n* Any physical attempts against our property or our host's data centers\r\n* Presence of autocomplete attribute on web forms\r\n* Missing public key pins\r\n* Missing best practices (we require evidence of a security vulnerability)\r\n* Missing cookie flags on non-sensitive cookies (we don't use cookie-based auth)\r\n* Host header injections unless you can show how they can lead to stealing user data.\r\n* Reports of spam (i.e. any report involving ability to send emails without rate limits)\r\n* Lack of CSRF tokens (unless there is evidence of actual, sensitive user action not protected by a token)\r\n* Login/logout CSRF\r\n* [Temporary] New reports of missing rate-limiting on Meteor methods. We recognize this is a problem and we're currently working our way through several hundred method calls.\r\n* [Temporary] New reports of authorization bypass on sensitive methods. We recognize this is a problem and we're currently working our way through a couple dozen sensitive method calls.\r\n\r\nYou must be the first person to report the issue to us. If a duplicate reproduction is submitted while the vulnerability is still in the wild, we will only award a bounty if the duplicate submissions provide more information or show the issue to be more extensive.\r\n\r\n## Questions\r\nFor any questions or clarification on this policy, feel free to email us at hello@legalrobot.com or ask us inside the app through the Intercom chat window (bottom right corner when logged in). All security reports must be performed through HackerOne so we can track reports and compensate you.\r\n\r\n##Thanks \u0026 Compensation\r\nWe believe in recognizing the work of others. If your work helps us improve the security of our service, we'd be happy to [acknowledge your contribution](/legalrobot/thanks). In addition to showing our appreciation for our security researchers, we also offer a monetary bounty for security issues, provided you follow the rules. More serious issues will be rewarded appropriately. Many researchers find similar or identical issues at the same time so unfortunately, duplicate issues will only receive our appreciation.","policy_html":"\u003cp\u003eIf you believe you have found a security vulnerability in Legal Robot, we encourage you to let us know right away.

Our mission is to provide best in class privacy for users and operational security for providers. We believe in open standards, data ownership and self-determination of users.\r\n\r\nSince our APIs and source code are both publicly documented and exposed we rely on strong authentication, crypto implementations and do not support the concept of security by obscurity. At the same time we're delivering the software in a way that it comes with secure defaults. For this program we offer both access to a hosted sandbox and invite you to install OX App Suite on your premises for research, contribution and usage.\r\n\r\nNo technology is perfect, and Open-Xchange believes that working with skilled security researchers across the globe is crucial in identifying weaknesses and build trust in technology. If you believe you've found a security issue in our product or service, we encourage you to notify us. We welcome working with you to resolve the issue promptly.\r\n\r\n# Scope\r\n**Our corporate website and related services are not in scope for this program, please report them to the contact provided at our website instead. This program focuses on the software we make.**\r\n\r\nSince we're open-source, you can use a locally installed instance of OX App Suite and have a look at its source-code. Especially when using local installations, we expect that you're using up to date versions on supported operating systems, hardened configurations of those services as well as a set of strong credentials.\r\n\r\nWe're offering a sandbox for you to execute research using shared accounts. Please note that other researchers may access and use your data on a shared account. Contact us if you need a dedicated user account, those are assigned to researchers which have a track record of valid reports. \r\n\r\n## Sandbox installation\r\n* https://sandbox.open-xchange.com/ (User: user{1..5}@sandbox-ox.tld_{1..4}, Pass: secret)\r\n  * {1..5} means all numbers from 1 to 5, for example, user2@sandbox-ox.tld_3\r\n* Service infrastructure\r\n* OX App Suite\r\n* OX Documents\r\n* OX Guard\r\n\r\n## App Stores\r\n* OX Drive for iOS and Android\r\n* OX Mail App for iOS and Android\r\n\r\n## Packages \u0026 Source Code\r\n* Learn more and find installation guides at https://oxpedia.org/ and https://documentation.open-xchange.com/\r\n* Source code can be cloned from https://code.open-xchange.com. The \"master\" branches for frontend, backend, calcengine, guard and office repos represent whats available as packages and as a sandbox\r\n\r\nAny other environments of OX App Suite providers or Open-Xchange itself are strictly out of scope and attack attempts will lead to permanent exclusion from this program. Please note that the provided research environment will be automatically reset. If your research is impeded by this reset, please let us know in advance.\r\n\r\nThis Program solely targets software vulnerabilities within OX App Suite, the sandbox, and the client software provided by Open-Xchange as listed. The report must be reproducible on currently supported versions and operating systems. Vulnerabilities need to be of practical relevancy and documented in a way that they can be reproduced. Send screen-shots, code, video; whatever helps to understand the flaw.\r\n\r\n# Non-Qualifying Vulnerabilities\r\n* Issues located within third party components for example MySQL, Apache or Java or Libraries\r\n* Social Engineering of Open-Xchange employees and contractors\r\n* Physical attacks against infrastructure, employees and offices of Open-Xchange\r\n* Upload, sending or inject malware to Open-Xchange and contractors\r\n* Research that results in spam, harassment or any kind of unauthorized communication\r\n* Using data acquired by compromising customer or employee accounts\r\n* Denial of service attacks that use high bandwidth or excessive requests\r\n* Vulnerabilities which have been made possible by purposely weakening the default configuration while using authorized privileged access\r\n* Vulnerabilities which are purely hypothetical or already publicly known or variations of such, including vulnerabilities that are made possible by exploiting another reported vulnerability.\r\n* Vulnerabilities which have already been reported to us (including reports received outside of Hackerone, for example from customers or pentests). Those are considered as \"Duplicate\" in case they describe a similar attack type, regardless of which component is affected.\r\n* Vulnerabilities that are present at multiple endpoints but the fix is being made at a central component that affects all endpoints. We reward based on vulnerability, not per endpoint.\r\n\r\n# Eligibility and Disclosure\r\n* You must agree and comply to the Program rules\r\n* You must be the first person to responsibly disclose an unknown issue\r\n* You must not publicly disclose the vulnerability prior to our public disclosure\r\n\r\nOur security team will review each committed finding and establish communication as soon as possible to reproduce and solve the reported vulnerability. Please allow 3 working days for our initial response. We ask you to make a good faith effort to avoid privacy violations, destruction of data and interruption or degradation of our service during your research.\r\n\r\n# Rewards\r\nBesides our respect and attribution of your work, Open-Xchange may provide rewards to eligible reporters of qualifying vulnerabilities. Rewards include:\r\n* Open-Xchange-branded Swag: T-Shirts, Polo Shirts, Hoodies\r\n* Minimum reward of $100 for vulnerabilities we consider to be serious, up to a maximum of $5000 for the most severe vulnerabilities\r\n\r\nDue to logistical issues and subsequent overhead and disappointment on both sides, we're not sending Swag packages to locations with notorious weak infrastructure. In this case we're awarding a amount below the minimum reward to compensate.\r\n\r\nWe will respond to your reports as soon as possible, bounty however will be assigned once a week after reviewing and rating the reports in terms of impact and risk.\r\n\r\nOpen-Xchange will determine in its discretion whether a reward should be granted and the amount of the reward. In particular we may choose to pay higher rewards for severe vulnerabilities or lower rewards for vulnerabilities that are considered less severe. When doing our estimation we're using CVSS and map the score against our payout-grades. This means certain aspects are of importance when considering the reward for a specific issue, for example:\r\n* Does it affect all users or would a practical attack require significant effort to compromise a wider range of users?\r\n* What level of authentication at the attacker and victim side is required to make the attack work?\r\n* Are social-engineering vectors (e.g. phishing) required to execute the vulnerability?\r\n* Is the attack vector remotely exploitable and are multiple steps required to execute it?\r\n* Does the attack require interaction of the victim to be effective?\r\n* Does the attack rely on weaknesses in third party components on the victims side?\r\n\r\nBased on this evaluation of impact and severity it could be that issues which is similar on a technical side gets different ratings and subsequently payout. We're not having a fixed amount of reward for a specific kind of issue. Note that the scale between minimum and maximum payout is not linear. We reserve the right to change these program rules at any time without prior announcement.\r\n\r\nThank you for helping keep Open-Xchange and its users safe!

We believe in open standards, data ownership and self-determination of users.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eSince our APIs and source code are both publicly documented and exposed we rely on strong authentication, crypto implementations and do not support the concept of security by obscurity. At the same time we\u0026#39;re delivering the software in a way that it comes with secure defaults. For this program we offer both access to a hosted sandbox and invite you to install OX App Suite on your premises for research, contribution and usage.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eNo technology is perfect, and Open-Xchange believes that working with skilled security researchers across the globe is crucial in identifying weaknesses and build trust in technology.

We will investigate all legitimate reports and do our best to fix any security vulnerability. \r\nWe are more than happy to work with all of you to resolve the issue and from our side we ask to be aligned with SecNews Disclosure Policy and Guidelines .\r\n\r\n# Scope\r\nAny web properties owned by SecNews are in scope for the program. Including:\r\n\r\n- *.secnews.gr\r\nSecNews visitors or authors are out of scope for our Vulnerability Disclosure program.\r\n\r\n# Eligibility\r\nIn order for your submission to be eligible:\r\n- You must agree to our Disclosure Policy.\r\n- You must be the first person to responsibly disclose an unknown issue. \r\n\r\nAll legitimate reports will be reviewed and assessed by SecNews's security team to determine if it is eligible. \r\nWe cannot accept submissions from children under the age of 13. Reporters under the age of 13 will not be eligible to receive SecNews rewards. We will find another way to recognize your effort.\r\n\r\n# Rewards\r\nFor each eligible vulnerability report, the reporter will receive one, part or maybe all of the below items \u0026 services according to the final reward panel decision:\r\n\r\n- Recognition on our webpage secnews.gr, in the top slider for more than 6 weeks . Promotion of the reporter to the social media and through our mailing list.\r\n- Article about the reporter or a full interview (only if the reporter wants publicity)\r\n- A limited edition of an EXCLUSIVE SecNews t-shirt. \r\n-6/12 months provision licenses of top level software \u0026 services related to information security, protection or penetration testing.\r\n- If the vulnerability reported is severe and of high importance a reward amount in range from 50€ - 3000€ is also provided.\r\n- The amounts listed are for good quality reports that don't require complex or unlikely user interaction\r\n- Less convincing or more constrained bug submissions will likely qualify for reduced reward amounts, as chosen at the discretion of the reward panel.\r\n- On top of these rewards, we offer either a range of  50€ - 500€ if a well-written patch is provided with the report. The amount for this reward is determined by the panel based on the quality and the effort required to write a good patch for the bug.\r\n\r\nMonetary compensation is offered under the program under specific circumstances and according to the rules above.\r\n\r\n# Disclosure Policy\r\n* Let us know as soon as possible upon discovery of a potential security issue, and we'll make every effort to quickly resolve the issue.\r\n* Provide us a reasonable amount of time to resolve the issue before any disclosure to the public or a third-party.\r\n* Make a good faith effort to avoid privacy violations, destruction of data, and interruption or degradation of our website.

In order to avoid misunderstandings and ambiguities, we apply the following guidelines; even if lengthy, please read them in their entirety before participating.\r\n\r\n# What is this about?\r\nWe want to hear about any security vulnerabilities in our services. In order to reward security researchers, we offer monetary rewards for eligible security vulnerability reports that are disclosed to us in a coordinated way. However, there are certain rules that need to be followed to ensure that your security research does not cause security risk to other users or their data, and to decrease the likelihood that your research would be flagged as a malicious intrusion attempt by our monitoring. We also want to be clear about certain aspects relating to acceptance of reports and payment of rewards in order to avoid any surprises.\r\n\r\nA \"security vulnerability\" is defined as an issue that causes a breach of confidentiality, integrity, or availability of the service or data, or applies to personal data (privately identifiable information) being stored or processed in a way that is not compliant with the current data protection legislation.\r\n\r\n# Eligibility and Coordinated Disclosure\r\nWe are pleased to reward everyone who submits valid reports which help us improve the security of LocalTapiola!

We regard these findings as \"heads-up\" warnings and our bounty policy is strict - the bounty for a vulnerability in a common 3rd party library that we will eventually fix and/or patch is always $100 USD - awarded on triage. In the name of making the Internet a safer place and in the case where the reporter does not want to handle the upstream reporting, we reserve the right to do so ourselves.\r\n\r\n# Permissible security research: We only allow security research, that -\r\n* Makes a good faith effort to avoid affecting third party services or their availability;\r\n* Makes a good faith effort not to affect or disclose other users' accounts, personal data, or content, and not to affect service availability to other users;\r\n* Only uses user account(s) that belong to you personally;\r\n* Only targets user account(s), user data or personal data that belong to you personally, or are bogus test data;\r\n* Only uses methods that are in compliance with all applicable local and national laws;\r\n* Does not use malicious or destructive payloads beyond what is technically required for a benign proof-of-concept demonstration;\r\n* Only targets services listed above, with the appropriate exclusions.\r\n\r\n\r\n# How to report a security vulnerability?\r\nIn your report, please describe, at least:\r\n* What you found;\r\n* Where exactly did you find it and steps to reproduce;\r\n\r\nExample: If the attack relates to a specific URL and a specific parameter, please provide that information in detail.\r\n* If the vulnerability applies to a service, please provide date and time (UTC) when you could reproduce the vulnerability (we may have deployed a new version since then).\r\n\r\nWe would be thankful for any further relevant technical information that you may have, especially if reproduction is tricky. If we cannot reproduce it, we cannot reward you. However, there is no need to describe the security impact of your finding - we understand security risks and we can figure that out.

Thank you for your understanding.\r\n\r\n# Rewards\r\nTo show our appreciation of responsible security researchers, LocalTapiola offers a monetary bounty for reports of qualifying security vulnerabilities.\r\n\r\nQualified security vulnerabilities will be rewarded based on severity and impact, to be determined by the LocalTapiola security team. Rewards may range from LocalTapiola-branded swag to monetary rewards from $100 USD up to $50,000 USD. Reward amounts will vary based upon the severity of the reported vulnerability, and eligibility is at LocalTapiola sole discretion.\r\n\r\nIn some cases, rewards may be consolidated into a single payout. For example, multiple reports of the same vulnerability across different parameters of a resource, or demonstrations of multiple attack vectors against a fundamental framework issue.\r\n\r\nIf you report several issues that are duplicates in different parts of the service (e.g., the same code running on different nodes or platforms), or part of a larger issue, these may be combined into one and only one reward may be paid.\r\n\r\nRewards may be reduced or declined if there is evidence of abuse, such as data exfiltration or withholding reports in order to chain multiple issues together.\r\n\r\nRewards are usually paid out once a verified finding is fixed. LocalTapiola aims to have fixes within 90 days of a verified report.\r\n\r\n#Legal\r\nIn connection with your participation in this program you agree to comply with all applicable local and national laws. \r\n\r\nYou may not participate in this program if you are a resident or individual located within a country appearing on any U.S. or E.U. sanctions list.\r\n\r\nVulnerabilities obtained by exploiting LocalTapiola users or employees are not eligible for a bounty and will result in immediate disqualification from the program. \r\n\r\nLocalTapiola has never given permission/authorization (either implied or explicit) to an individual or group of individuals to extract personal information or content of LocalTapiola customers and publicize this information on the open, public-facing Internet without customer consent, nor has LocalTapiola ever given permission for programs or data belonging to LocalTapiola to be modified or corrupted in order to extract and publicly disclose data belonging to LocalTapiola.\r\n\r\nLocalTapiola reserves the right to discontinue this reward program and change its terms at any time without prior notification.

Although the code is written with C, it's a little bit special C variant that makes it much more difficult to write security holes accidentally than with most other C-based projects. Dovecot is an excellent choice for both small and large installations. It is fast, simple to set up, requires no special administration and it uses very little memory.\r\n\r\nScope\r\n---------\r\nSince we're open-source, you can use a locally installed instance of Dovecot. Especially when using local installations, we expect that you're using up to date versions on supported operating systems, hardened configurations of those services as well as a set of strong credentials. \r\n\r\nDovecot core open-source repository:\r\n- Here is link where you find Open Source code: https://github.com/dovecot/core\r\n- Learn more and find installation guides at http://wiki2.dovecot.org\r\n\r\nThis Program solely targets software vulnerabilities within. The report must be reproducible on currently supported versions and operating systems. Vulnerabilities need to be documented in a way that they can be reproduced. Send screen-shots, code, video; whatever helps to understand the flaw.\r\n\r\nNon-Qualifying Vulnerabilities\r\n--------------------------------------------\r\n- Issues located within third party components\r\n- Social Engineering of Dovecot employees and contractors\r\n- Physical attacks against infrastructure, employees and offices of Dovecot\r\n- Upload, sending or inject malware to Dovecot employees and contractors\r\n- Research that results in spam, harassment or any kind of unauthorized communication\r\n- Using data acquired by compromising customer or employee accounts\r\n- Vulnerabilities which have been made possible by purposely weakening the default configuration while using authorized privileged access\r\n- Vulnerabilities which are already publicly known or variations of such\r\n- Denial of service attacks\r\n- **Vulnerabilities in our websites**\r\n- Issues in our DNS domains\r\n\r\nEligibility and Disclosure\r\n-----------------------------------\r\n- You must agree and comply to our Program rules\r\n- You must be the first person to responsibly disclose an unknown issue\r\n- You must not publicly disclose the vulnerability prior to our public disclosure\r\n\r\nOur security team will review each committed finding and establish communication as soon as possible to reproduce and solve the reported vulnerability. Please allow 3 working days for our initial response. We ask you to make a good faith effort to avoid privacy violations, destruction of data and interruption or degradation of our service during your research.\r\n\r\nRewards\r\n-------------\r\nBesides our respect and attribution, Dovecot may provide rewards to eligible reporters of qualifying vulnerabilities. Rewards include:\r\n- Dovecot branded clothing: T-Shirts, Polo Shirts, Hoodies\r\n- Minimum reward of $100 USD for vulnerabilities we consider to be serious, up to a maximum of $5000 USD for the most severe vulnerabilities.\r\n- For reward, you must show that there is potential for damage or exposure of private data.

Although the code is written with C, it\u0026#39;s a little bit special C variant that makes it much more difficult to write security holes accidentally than with most other C-based projects.

This means, for example, that we will issue a relatively high reward for a vulnerability that has the potential to leak sensitive user data, but that we will issue little to no reward for a vulnerability that allows an attacker to deface a microsite. When we have our reward meetings, we always ask one question: If a malicious attacker abuses this, how bad off are we? We assume the worst and pay out the bug accordingly.\r\n\r\nIf we receive several reports for the same issue, we offer the bounty to the earliest report for which we had enough actionable information to identify the issue. We don't want to encourage people spamming us with vague issues in an attempt to be first.\r\n\r\nIf a single fix fixes multiple vulnerabilities, we treat this as a single vulnerability.  For example, if you find 3 vulnerabilities in a WordPress plugin we use, and our fix is to remove the plugin, this will receive a single bounty, determined, as always, by impact.\r\n\r\nThe payout ranges on this page are guidelines to express roughly how we think about the severity of classes of issues. They are not exact rules. There can be attributes of bugs that make them more or less severe, which will affect the payout. For example, if a vulnerability affects only a small population of users, it will likely receive a lower reward than a similar vulnerability that affects a larger population of users. To date, we have most commonly rewarded on the top end of our published payout ranges.\r\n\r\nAt the end of the day, all reward amounts are at our discretion, but we aim to be fair. Some researchers won't agree with some of our decisions, but we're paying out to the best of our ethical ability and trust that the majority of researchers will consider their rewards fair and in many cases generous. We will adapt as the program continues.\r\n\r\n## Things you should expect to receive little to no bounty for\r\n* Microsites with little to no user data\r\n* Issues requiring user-interaction\r\n* Outdated wordpress instances\r\n* Most brute forcing issues\r\n\r\n## Bounty Payout Range\r\nN.B: the amounts listed here are the maximum we can pay for these categories of issues. This is meant as rough guidance on how we think about rewarding issues, ultimately we will reward largely based on the impact of the issue but at our discretion. \r\n\r\n* **Critical issues ($10,000)** - Remote code execution on a production server. Exposure of information that identifies individuals (social security numbers, credit card numbers, bank account numbers, driver license images) Full account takeover of rider/partner account without interaction. Payment or partner invoice information exposure at scale. Potential access to source code. XSS in Toolshed (our internal account management system), or server-side request forgery (SSRF). Vulnerabilities leading to the compromise of an employee account (with a way to bypass two-factor).\r\n\r\n* **Significant Issues ($5,000)** - Stored Cross-site Scripting which can cause significant brand damage (e.g. in a homepage), missing authorization checks leading to the exposure of email addresses, date of birth, names, phone numbers, etc.\r\n\r\n* **Medium Issues ($3,000)** - Reflected Cross-site Scripting (XSS), most Cross-site Request Forgery (CSRF) issues, access control issues which do not exposed PII but affect other accounts, some account validation bypasses (being able to change driver picture, etc). Any vulnerability which allows the bulk lookup of user UUIDs (e.g. turn an auto-incrementing ID into a UUID, turn an email into a UUID).\r\n\r\n* **Fraud Issues** - Send these to `ext-uber-fraud@uber.com`. We currently do not reward for fraud issues. \r\n\r\n# Miscellany\r\n\r\n## Reporting Guidelines\r\nWe need detailed written steps to reproduce. We do not accept reports that include only a video.\r\n\r\n## Policy Changes\r\nYou can view the changes to this policy over time at [hackerone.com/uber/policy_versions](https://hackerone.com/uber/policy_versions).\r\n\r\n## Fraud issues\r\nIf you’d like to report an issue related to fraud, please contact ext-uber-fraud@uber.com. These type of issues are important but we unfortunately cannot reward issues if this type at this time. Specifically promo code fraud and give-get fraud is abuse of our promotional offers and referral codes in order to get free rides from Uber are a common submission. We do not consider these in scope for our bug bounty program at this time unless they show an explicit technical vulnerability in our software.  Lack of verification for things such as phone numbers, credit cards, etc are all fraud related issues and are not in scope for this bug bounty program.\r\n\r\n## Examples of good bugs\r\n* https://fin1te.net/articles/uber-turning-self-xss-into-good-xss/\r\n* http://blog.portswigger.net/2016/04/adapting-angularjs-payloads-to-exploit.html\r\n* http://blog.orange.tw/2016/04/bug-bounty-uber-ubercom-remote-code_7.html\r\n* https://labs.integrity.pt/articles/uber-hacking-how-we-found-out-who-you-are-where-you-are-and-where-you-went/\r\n\r\n# Frequently Asked Questions\r\n\r\n## Can I blog about my bug?\r\nYes, but we ask that you wait until the issue is both fixed and paid out before you publish the blog post. We also prefer that you request disclosure through HackerOne so that readers of your blog post can get the full background on the issue.\r\n\r\n## What is your policy on chaining bugs and privilege escalation?\r\nChaining of bugs is not frowned upon in any way, we love to see clever exploit chains! However, if you have managed to compromise an Uber-owned server we do not allow for escalations such as port scanning internal networks, privilege escalation attempts, attempting to pivot to other systems, etc. If you get access to an Uber server please report it us and we will reward you with an appropriate bounty taking into full consideration the severity of what could be done. Chaining a CSRF vulnerability with a self XSS? Nice! Using AWS access key to dump user info? Not cool.\r\n\r\n## Do you provide test accounts?\r\nAs of this time we do not have a good system for creating test accounts for our bug bounty submitters. Please create an account as you would normally and perform testing with that account or accounts.  Whenever possible only test against yourself, never other users. If there is ever a situation where you cannot test a bug while adhering to this please let us know and we will help figure out an appropriate solution.\r\n\r\n## What is a user UUID and when do you reward for enumeration of it?\r\nWe reward for issues which allow you to enumerate bulk user UUID's via a phone number or email address. For example, if there's an endpoint that allows you to submit an email and the response contains that user's UUID - this is a vulnerability we would reward for. To verify this you should compare the UUID you're seeing with your own email. To get your personal account UUID visit `help.uber.com` after authenticating and copy and paste the following JavaScript in your browser's developer console:\r\n```js\r\nalert(JSON.parse($(\"#web-support-data-script\").text).user.uuid);\r\n```\r\n(We reward for this bug because we want to make it harder to perform bulk insecure direct object reference attacks against our users).\r\n\r\n## What is a vehicle UUID and when do you reward for enumeration of it?\r\nA vehicle UUID uniquely identifies a vehicle within our systems. Any instance where you could collect a lot of vehicle uuids is probably interesting to us, depending on the circumstances.\r\nTo get a list of your vehicle UUIDs, navigate to https://partners.uber.com/vehicles/ and paste the following into your browser’s development console:\r\n```js\r\nvuids = document.querySelectorAll( \"#vehicle-uuid\" );for( var i = 0;i\u003cvuids.length;i++){console.log( vuids[i].value )};\r\n```\r\n\r\n## What about public disclosure?\r\nFound a particularly interesting or clever bug in an Uber service? We’re more than happy to publicly disclose your bug once it has been remediated by our developers. Please note that in certain situations we may request more time to investigate an issue internally to ensure that it is properly fixed across all Uber services. Public disclosure before Uber has had time to remediate an issue is grounds for immediate forfeiture of any reward as well as possible removal from the bug bounty program.\r\n\r\n## What is an Uber microsite?\r\nAn Uber microsite is a website which is not explicitly listed in the scope above but is made by an Uber employee and owned by Uber. The most common examples of microsites include Uber city sites, blogs, and partner incentive sites.\r\n\r\n## Are Uber microsites (for example, our blogs and city-specific Uber sites) in scope?\r\nMicrosites are an important part of how Uber reaches people in diverse local markets all around the world. Since they have smaller audiences, shouldn't contain much or any user data and aren’t part of the our core services, the impact of issues on these sites is significantly less severe. Since we are primary interested in vulnerabilities which could lead to the exfiltration of customer information, vulnerabilities in microsite services will not be rewarded for except in extraordinary circumstances.

This means, for example, that we will issue a relatively high reward for a vulnerability that has the potential to leak sensitive user data, but that we will issue little to no reward for a vulnerability that allows an attacker to deface a microsite. When we have our reward meetings, we always ask one question: If a malicious attacker abuses this, how bad off are we? We assume the worst and pay out the bug accordingly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eIf we receive several reports for the same issue, we offer the bounty to the earliest report for which we had enough actionable information to identify the issue. We don\u0026#39;t want to encourage people spamming us with vague issues in an attempt to be first.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eIf a single fix fixes multiple vulnerabilities, we treat this as a single vulnerability.  For example, if you find 3 vulnerabilities in a WordPress plugin we use, and our fix is to remove the plugin, this will receive a single bounty, determined, as always, by impact.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe payout ranges on this page are guidelines to express roughly how we think about the severity of classes of issues. They are not exact rules. There can be attributes of bugs that make them more or less severe, which will affect the payout. For example, if a vulnerability affects only a small population of users, it will likely receive a lower reward than a similar vulnerability that affects a larger population of users. To date, we have most commonly rewarded on the top end of our published payout ranges.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eAt the end of the day, all reward amounts are at our discretion, but we aim to be fair. Some researchers won\u0026#39;t agree with some of our decisions, but we\u0026#39;re paying out to the best of our ethical ability and trust that the majority of researchers will consider their rewards fair and in many cases generous.

Some have spammed projects with invalid bug reports hoping to collect bounties for pressing a button and running an automated analysis tool. This is not cool.\r\n2. There is a potential for the developers of a project to declare all security bug reports as invalid to save money.\r\n\r\nOur team members have an established history of reporting vulnerabilities to large open source projects. **We aren't in the business of ripping people off.** When in doubt, our policy is to err on the side of generosity.\r\n\r\n## Scope\r\n\r\nWe're only interested in the *source* repositories in the [ParagonIE](https://github.com/paragonie) organization on Github that have at least seen a version `1.0.0` stable release, not any repositories we forked (which we usually only do when fixing a security vulnerability in the upstream repository). We're not interest in third-party integration settings (i.e. Dockerfiles or .travis.yml).\r\n\r\nWe're not interested in trivial problems with our website (e.g. \"missing SPF headers\").\r\n\r\nBugs that require a specific user agent (i.e. they only affect Internet Explorer), browser extension, ActiveX plugin, etc. will be promptly fixed, should a mitigation exist, but we are not going to pay a bounty for a bug introduced by software we don't control.\r\n\r\n### Please do *not* submit any of the following:\r\n\r\n* Any non-critical security concerns with our domain name and/or website\r\n* Very minor security concerns with alpha software (anything for which the latest release is not at least `1.0.0`)\r\n\r\n## No Proof-of-Concept Required\r\n\r\nWe might ask for one if we feel we do not understand some of the details pertaining to a specific vulnerability. We certainly appreciate them if you include them in your report, but we believe **the burden lies with the developer to prove their software *is* secure** rather than with the researcher to prove that it isn't.\r\n\r\nIn our experience, most bugs are simpler to fix than they are to exploit.","policy_html":"\u003ch1 id=\"an-invitation-to-security-researchers\"\u003eAn Invitation to Security Researchers\u003c/h1\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eEvery company says they take security \u0026quot;very seriously.\u0026quot; Rather than bore anyone with banal boilerplate, here are some quick answers followed by detailed elaboration.

If that convinces us to change our code (EVEN IF IT’S A MINOR BUG) we will reward you with a bounty. Even if we do not change our code, we will mark it as INFORMATIVE rather than NOT APPLICABLE  to avoid discouragement with negative hackerone points :)\r\n\r\n# Open-Source code\r\nPlease note that \r\nBinary.com's front-end code is open-sourced at \r\nhttps://github.com/binary-com/binary-static/, \r\ndevelopers.binary.com is open-sourced at\r\n https://github.com/binary-com/websockets, \r\n\r\nand other Binary.com-related code is open-sourced at\r\n https://github.com/binary-com/ \r\n- Please feel free to report any vulnerabilities found in these codes by submitting a pull-request in github.

Revive Adserver and all of its predecessors have been around since 1998, and many developers have worked on the code since the start of the project. Unsafe code may have slipped in as a result.\r\n\r\nThere are thousands of known installations of Revive Adserver worldwide. Since ad servers typically interact with many internet users, they are an interesting target for people with bad intentions, for example to spread malicious code that is added to advertisements.\r\n\r\nBeing hacked is not the same as having found a vulnerability!\r\n---\r\nVery often, what people believe to be security vulnerabilities, turn out to be cases of (unauthorized) access to an installation through password guessing, social engineering or (sadly) simply using extremely weak passwords, or other methods not related to the code at all.\r\n\r\nIf your own ad server installation has been compromised, do not report it here! This program is only for reporting security vulnerabilities you have discovered in our code.\r\n\r\nRead these important rules\r\n------------------------\r\n- **IMPORTANT: DO NOT TEST ```revive-adserver.com```**. Do not test an instance of Revive Adserver that you do not own. This includes any existing instance you might find anywhere on the web. If you report an issue against an instance you do not own, it will not be accepted. Instead, install your own instance of Revive Adserver. This will let you test the Revive Adserver software without disrupting others.\r\n- **IMPORTANT: SERVER CONFIGURATION ISSUES DO NOT QUALIFY**. Do not report configuration issues with ```revive-adserver.com``` etc. For example: software versions, SPF headers, etc. These are outside of program scope. The goal of this program is to find vulnerabilities in the Revive Adserver software itself. For instructions on installing your own instance of Revive Adserver, see the [Installation Guide](http://www.revive-adserver.com/support/installation/). Please make sure you study the [Technical Requirements](http://www.revive-adserver.com/support/requirements/) first.\r\n- Report issue only in relation to copies of the software you've [downloaded from the Revive Adserver website](http://www.revive-adserver.com/download/). Please do not test a git clone or github tarball as it will contain files and tools used for testing and packaging that are not expected to be deployed on a production server.\r\n- Report issues only in relation to the most recently released version of our software. If you've found an issue in an older version, it is possible that it has already been reported and fixed. Carefully study our [Security Advisories](http://www.revive-adserver.com/security/) before reporting any issues. If you're using an older version of the software, please [upgrade first](http://www.revive-adserver.com/support/upgrading/), then test again.\r\n- We receive many reports from researchers who do not read these rules. To prove that you've read and understood these rules, please include the word \"Cricetinae\" somewhere in the first paragraph of your report. If you do not, your report will be closed as invalid automatically, which may reflect on your reputation.\r\n\r\nRequirements\r\n----\r\n- Test on your own installation. We're open source, so grab a copy from our [site](http://www.revive-adserver.com/download/) and [install](http://www.revive-adserver.com/support/installation/) it on your own server.\r\n- Be clear. We totally get that you're not paid to do this. Here's a coincidence, neither are we! There's no huge corporate benefactor behind Revive Adserver, so we're not in a position to spend our precious time on this planet to decipher your report. You spent the time finding the issue, so please spend an extra 2 minutes to spell out what you're able to do with it so we can easily understand the severity of the issue. Please provide specific and exact examples and steps to reproduce. Please consider if you can give us access to your installation if you think it might help us to study your report.\r\n- Be responsible. We're here because we want to know vulnerabilities before the world does, so we have a chance to provide a solution in a reasonable time frame. We assume you're here for the same. Report issues directly to us here. Do not publicly disclose anything before we've been in touch with you.\r\n- Vulnerabilities in third-party plugins for Revive Adserver should not be reported here, you should contact the author of the code or product.\r\n\r\nLevels of Severity\r\n-----\r\n- Critical: someone with no access is able to inject code/malware to be distributed by the delivery engine of a Revive Adserver instance. This includes getting unauthorized user interface access to the instance. This is a huge deal and we will be all over it.\r\n- Important: someone with no access can do something that might impact someone who does have access, but cannot distribute malware via the delivery engine.\r\n- Moderate: someone who already has a restricted UI access (i.e. not admin) can do something they shouldn't. Typically it's SQL injection or cross site scripting vulnerabilities but they require you already to have access to the ad management user interface. Being able to get a level of access greater than what you are supposed to have would likely graduate a vulnerability into a critical issue.\r\n- Minor: something that's less than ideal, but can't be used to do anything nefarious today. Things that only impact the browsing experience of the attacker or that are unlikely/hard to be exploited very likely fall into this category.\r\n\r\nIf you've found any issue with our code that you consider to be a bug, but which has no security impact, please do not report it here! Instead, [open an issue on our Github project](https://github.com/revive-adserver/revive-adserver/issues).\r\n\r\nBounty program\r\n----\r\nThe Revive Adserver project is open source and, alas, has no budget for a proper bounty program.\r\n\r\nResponse\r\n----\r\n- We will try to respond to your reports within 72 hours.\r\n- We will fix security issues within a reasonable timeline, based on the severity as determined after triage.\r\n- We've got lots of honor for those who submit issues related to our software, but no cash. And we truly believe in recognizing the work of others.\r\n\r\nFile your report\r\n------\r\nNow that you've read the policy and instructions above, please go ahead and **[report the issue you discovered](https://hackerone.com/revive_adserver/reports/new)**.\r\n\r\nAcknowledgement\r\n---\r\nLarge parts of the text above have been copied almost verbatim from [Phabricator](https://hackerone.com/phabricator) and [concrete5](https://hackerone.com/concrete5), if you have extra time to give, those are great place to give it!","policy_html":"\u003ch2 id=\"introduction-to-revive-adserver\"\u003eIntroduction to Revive Adserver\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eRevive Adserver is a free open source ad serving system formerly known as OpenX Source.

Typically it\u0026#39;s SQL injection or cross site scripting vulnerabilities but they require you already to have access to the ad management user interface. Being able to get a level of access greater than what you are supposed to have would likely graduate a vulnerability into a critical issue.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eMinor: something that\u0026#39;s less than ideal, but can\u0026#39;t be used to do anything nefarious today.

Public disclosure prior to resolution and without explicit confirmation by the ownCloud Security Team will result in disqualification for the bounty program.\r\n\r\nWe believe in transparency and will publicly disclose each applicable report.\r\n\r\n# Eligible ownCloud Components\r\nOnly ownCloud Server, the Enterprise Edition applications, the official ownCloud iOS and Android mobile apps and the Windows, Mac and Linux desktop clients are eligible for a bug bounty payout. ownCloud is not able to cover the entire server and mobile app spectrum in this security bug bounty program. We cannot offer a bounty for elements outside of those listed above. A more thorough list of the components eligible for the program is available below.\r\n\r\n## ownCloud Server \r\nThe latest 8.1, 8.2 and 9.0 release of ownCloud are eligible for bounties. Only covers components shipped with the ownCloud Server and the ownCloud Enterprise Edition. \r\nYou can download the source code of the free and open-source community version from https://owncloud.org/install/#instructions-server (do use the ZIP or tarballs!), everything except the following items is included within the scope:\r\n\r\n- The encryption app (while we are creating a threat model)\r\n- Problems considering the SSL/TLS verification in the \"files_external\" application.\r\n\r\nNote that if you enable “apps” via the “apps” setting from another category than “Not enabled” they will be downloaded from the app store and are not shipped per default and thus do not qualify. However, any additional  code addition shipped within official Enterprise edition from ownCloud does qualify for this program.\r\n\r\nTo ensure that you are using the latest version use our daily builds:\r\n\r\n- ownCloud 8.1: https://download.owncloud.org/community/owncloud-daily-stable8.1.tar.bz2\r\n- ownCloud 8.2: https://download.owncloud.org/community/owncloud-daily-stable8.2.tar.bz2\r\n- ownCloud 9.0: https://download.owncloud.org/community/owncloud-daily-stable9.tar.bz2\r\n\r\n### Qualifying vulnerabilities\r\nBelow is a sample of vulnerabilities that generally qualify for the bug bounty program for the ownCloud Server and supported server applications. Each reported vulnerability is assessed on an individual basis, and this list may evolve over time as the project expands. The current list includes:\r\n- Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)\r\n- Cross-Site-Request-Forgery with valid security impact (CSRF)\r\n- Remote Code Execution (RCE)\r\n- SQL Injection\r\n- Unrestricted file access\r\n- Access to files of other users\r\n- XML External Entity Processing (XXE)\r\n\r\nNote that we consider any bug caused by already known and fixed PHP issues as a non-issue. This means that you should always test using the latest available PHP release (of the 5.5, 5.6 or 7.0 branch) running on mod_php.\r\n\r\n### Non-Qualifying vulnerabilities\r\nBelow is a short list of vulnerabilities that generally do not qualify for the bug bounty program for the ownCloud Server and supported server applications. This is not a comprehensive list, merely a representative sample:\r\n- Vulnerabilities not exploitable within ownCloud Server or the Enterprise Edition of ownCloud without any third-party applications\r\n- Vulnerabilities relying on the existence of plugins such as Flash\r\n- Vulnerabilities that can only be triggered by administrators\r\n- Flaws affecting the users of out-of-date browsers and plugins\r\n- Self-XSS\r\n- Hosting malware/arbitrary content on an ownCloud instance\r\n- Source code disclosure\r\n- User enumeration\r\n- Sessions of user not expiring after password has changed\r\n- Bypass of malware detection\r\n- Brute forcing of login credentials or other sensitive information\r\n- Presence of autocomplete attribute on forms\r\n- Missing flags on non-sensitive cookies\r\n- Use of a known-vulnerable library without proof of exploitability\r\n- Issues caused by misconfiguration of the ownCloud instance (such as an exposed data directory)\r\n- Login and logout CSRF\r\n- Denial of Service / DoS\r\n- Open Redirectors\r\n- No password check after user changes email / display name / etc.\r\n- Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF)\r\n- Browser may cache sensitive information\r\n- Issues that involve a malicious installed application on the device\r\n- Version enumeration\r\n- Weak password policy\r\n- Password reset token does not expire after password change\r\n- BREACH (we do recommend in our hardening guideline to disable HTTP compression)\r\n- CSRF token in GET parameter\r\n- CSRF without security impact (such as being able to force the victim to download a file)\r\n- Content Spoofing\r\n- Flooding users (such as with password reset mails)\r\n- Sensitive information in log or sessions\r\n- CSRF on publicly accessible functionalities\r\n- Bugs in the ownCloud appstore at apps.owncloud.com\r\n\r\n## Desktop application\r\nThe release candidate of the latest ownCloud desktop application as available from https://owncloud.org/install/#install-clients is eligible for the ownCloud Security Bug Bounty Program.\r\n\r\nNote that the ownCloud server itself is considered a trusted endpoint in our threat model and an eligible vulnerability and needs to be triggered by an arbitrary attacker, rather than a malicious ownCloud instance.\r\n\r\n### Qualifying vulnerabilities\r\n\r\n- Interception of HTTPS encrypted traffic without certificate warning\r\n- Arbitrary Code Execution\r\n- SQL Injection\r\n\r\n### Non-Qualifying vulnerabilities\r\n\r\n- Use of a known-vulnerable library without proof of exploitability\r\n- Denial of Service / DoS\r\n- Issues that involve a malicious installed application on the device\r\n\r\n## iOS application\r\nThe latest ownCloud iOS application as [available from the Apple AppStore](https://itunes.apple.com/en/app/owncloud/id543672169) is eligible for the ownCloud Security Bug Bounty Program.\r\n\r\nNote that the ownCloud server itself is considered a trusted endpoint in our threat model and an eligible vulnerability thus usually needs not to be triggered by a malicious ownCloud instance but by an arbitrary attacker.\r\n\r\n### Qualifying vulnerabilities\r\n\r\n- Interception of HTTPS encrypted traffic without certificate warning\r\n- Arbitrary Code Execution\r\n- SQL Injection\r\n- Other applications can gain access to sensitive ownCloud data without user permission (i.e. credentials or files) \r\n\r\n### Non-Qualifying vulnerabilities\r\n\r\n- Vulnerabilities requiring physical access to the device \r\n- Vulnerabilities requiring a jailbroken device\r\n- Denial of Service / DoS\r\n- Use of a known-vulnerable library without proof of exploitability\r\n\r\n## Android application\r\nThe latest ownCloud Android application as [available from the Play Store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.owncloud.android) is eligible for the ownCloud Security Bug Bounty Program.\r\n\r\n### Qualifying vulnerabilities\r\n\r\n- Interception of HTTPS encrypted traffic without certificate warning\r\n- Arbitrary Code Execution\r\n- SQL Injection\r\n- Other applications can gain access to user credentials without user permissions\r\n\r\n### Non-Qualifying vulnerabilities\r\n\r\n- Vulnerabilities requiring physical access to the device \r\n- Vulnerabilities requiring a jailbreak device\r\n- Tap-jacking and UI-redressing attacks that involve tricking the user into tapping a UI element\r\n- Issues that require debugging access (ADB) to the device\r\n- Bugs that simply cause an app to crash\r\n- Use of a known-vulnerable library without proof of exploitability\r\n- Other Android application with access to external/internal storage gaining access to stored files/thumbnails/… (excluding credentials)\r\n- Insecure storage of PIN\r\n\r\n# FAQ\r\n**Q: Why do you exclude the ownCloud websites and infrastructure?**\r\nA: For the time being we want to focus our efforts on ownCloud Server instead of vulnerabilities within our website and infrastructure. However, if you find a security bug in our website or infrastructure we welcome any report, though we cannot offer a monetary incentive.\r\n\r\n**Q: Why is this Security Bug Bounty Program excluding “Community Edition” apps?**\r\nA: ownCloud Server is a platform at the core of all ownCloud installation, whether free or paid. This benefits everyone, including the ownCloud community, ownCloud customers and ownCloud. Inc. However, there are many apps that have been built for ownCloud that we do not know, have not inspected, do not maintain, and do not commercially support. For this reason, we cannot stand behind the quality of these apps or offer a bounty on these apps at this time. \r\n\r\n**Q: Where can I get the Android or iOS app for free?**\r\nA: You can compile it from the sources available from https://github.com/owncloud/android and https://github.com/owncloud/ios\r\n\r\n**Q: How much time will it take you to fix a vulnerability?**\r\nA: We have pledged to fix any vulnerability within 90 days after report. Usually we are able to have a patch within less than 30 days. We may however in case of more complicated vulnerabilities need some more time. \r\n\r\n**Q: Do I qualify if I contributed the vulnerable code or am an employee of ownCloud?**\r\nA: Neither contributions by employees of ownCloud nor contributions from persons that contributed the vulnerable code qualify for the bounty program.\r\n\r\n**Q: Is there a limit to the number of bugs I can submit?**\r\nA: There is no limitation. Please note that invalid submissions do decrease your overall rating on HackerOne. Additionally, if you report several issues with closely related root causes, we may choose to pay only one bounty.\r\n\r\n**Q: Where should I report bugs without security implication or hardening / best practise guidance?**\r\nA: Please report all non-security bugs as well as general hardening advice at https://github.com/owncloud/core. Rule of thumb: if it on it's own is not directly exploitable it is likely to be hardening.\r\n","policy_html":"\u003cp\u003eWe created the ownCloud Security Bug Bounty Program to reward security researchers for finding issues in the ownCloud Server, and in so doing help strengthen ownCloud Server for customers, users and the community.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eThis is \u003cu\u003enot\u003c/u\u003e about our websites, owncloud.com or owncloud.org - security issues there \u003cu\u003edo not earn bounties\u003c/u\u003e.

This benefits everyone, including the ownCloud community, ownCloud customers and ownCloud. Inc. However, there are many apps that have been built for ownCloud that we do not know, have not inspected, do not maintain, and do not commercially support.

This should include any links you clicked on, pages you visited, URLs, user IDs, etc. Images and video can be helpful if you also include written explanations.\r\n* Clear descriptions of any accounts used in your report and the relationships between them. Please do not use the same name on multiple accounts to avoid confusion.\r\n* Quality before quantity. Many of our highest-paid reports had just a few lines of precise, clear explanations.\r\n* If you send a video, consider these tips:\r\n * Keep it short by showing only the parts necessary to demonstrate the bug once. (Remove or redo mistakes that might happen while recording.)\r\n * Record at a resolution where text or URLs are readable (at least 480p; 1080p is usually not necessary.)\r\n * Provide commentary or instructions in your messages or video description instead of typing on-screen during the video.\r\n * Setting Flox.io to English while recording steps helps us quickly identify what features you use.\r\n * If a large amount of text appears in your video, please include a copy in your messages as well.\r\n * Keep the video private either by uploading it as an attachment or posting it privately online (such as with a hidden link or password that you send to us.)\r\n\r\n# Ineligible Reports and False Positives\r\n\r\n* User enumeration. Many of the platforms we use (WordPress, Piwik, Gitlab) provide their own bounties, and while we will happily contribute upstream patches, that is unlikely to result in a bounty for you.\r\n* Denial-of-service attacks. No, seriously; stop trying to take us out, please.\r\n* Security issues in third-party apps or websites that integrate with Flox.io. These are not managed by Flox and do not qualify under our guidelines for security testing.\r\n* Open redirects. Any open redirects are likely intentional at this time.\r\n* Note that public information also includes your username, vanity URLs, ID, name, current cover photo, gender, and anything you've shared publicly.\r\n* Profile pictures available publicly. Your current profile picture is always considered public (regardless of size or resolution.)\r\n* Spam or social engineering techniques.\r\n* Content injection. Posting content on Flox.io is a core feature, and content injection (also \"content spoofing\" or \"HTML injection\") is ineligible unless you can clearly demonstrate a significant risk.\r\n* Sending messages to anyone on Flox.io.\r\n* Accessing photos via raw image URLs from our CDN.\r\n* Executing scripts on sandboxed domains.","policy_html":"\u003cp\u003eIf you believe you have found a security vulnerability on Flox.io, we encourage you to let us know right away.

If a report is not detailed enough to reproduce the issue, it will not be eligible for a bounty. We also ask you to cite references and not to copy/paste entire reports. Reports copied entirely or mostly from elsewhere will not be eligible for a bounty.\r\n\r\nWe especially appreciate reports containing the affected code from our [GitHub repository](https://github.com/gratipay), and possibly even patches, and we encourage you to test our platform by [setting up Gratipay locally](https://github.com/gratipay/gratipay.com#quick-start). That way you can test all sorts of payloads to your heart's content.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Email\r\n\r\nWe prefer that you file reports on HackerOne, but we also accept reports via email to security@gratipay.com. Please include the following details with your report:\r\n\r\n*   Description of the location and potential impact of the vulnerability;\r\n*   A detailed description of the steps required to reproduce the vulnerability (POC scripts, screenshots, and compressed screen captures are all helpful to us); and\r\n*   Your name/handle and a link for recognition in our legacy [Hall of Fame](https://gratipay.com/about/security/hall-of-fame) (if reporting via email and not willing to join HackerOne).\r\n\r\nTo encrypt your message, you may use [our PGP key](https://gratipay.com/about/security/pgp.asc):\r\n\r\n```sh\r\n$ curl https://gratipay.com/about/security/pgp.asc | gpg --import\r\ngpg: key 7A5F6B30: \"Gratipay Security \u003csecurity@gratipay.com\u003e\" imported\r\ngpg: Total number processed: 1\r\ngpg:               imported: 1\r\n$\r\n```\r\n\r\nWe only use PGP to decrypt messages, never to encrypt messages or authenticate our identity. Instead, we'll create a ticket on HackerOne to track your report, which we'll invite you to join (see our [internal policy document](http://inside.gratipay.com/howto/handle-security-issues) for more details).

When properly reported, we will quickly investigate all legitimate reports of security vulnerabilities and address identified problems. We have adopted a responsible disclosure policy to encourage reporting of security vulnerabilities.\r\n\r\nWe recognize the important role that security researchers and our community play in keeping Marktplaats secure and our customers safe. In the event you discover a security vulnerability in a Marktplaats site, mobile app or product, please notify us according to our responsible disclosure guidelines below.\r\n\r\n_The guidelines for responsible disclosure:_\r\n* Share the security issue with us without making it public on social media, message boards, mailing lists and other forums.\r\n* Allow us a reasonable amount of time (at least 30 days from where we receive your disclosure under this process) to respond to the issue before disclosing it to others.\r\n* Provide full details of the security issue, including Proof-of-Concept URL, the details of the system where the tests were conducted and detailed reproduction steps.\r\nDo not engage in security research that involves:\r\n* Potential or actual damage to users, systems, data or applications.\r\n* Use of an exploit\r\n   * To view other users’ data;\r\n   * That involves the corruption of data; and/or\r\n   * That conducts any activities that may disrupt our services.\r\n* The use of port scans on our network blocks or executing DDoS attacks.\r\n\r\nIf you give us reasonable time to respond to your report before making any information public and make a good faith effort to avoid privacy violations, destruction of data and interruption or degradation of our service during your research, we will not bring any lawsuit against you or ask law enforcement to investigate you, unless we have reason to believe that you do not act in good faith.\r\n\r\n##Bounty security vulnerability\r\nTo show our appreciation for our security researchers and community, we offer a monetary bounty for certain qualifying security vulnerabilities.

We will reject any submission to the whitehat program where the issue being reported is that a user or store administrator is able to upload arbitrary files to our CDN or execute javascript in the context of a CDN domain.\r\n* CSRF access to modify cart\r\n* Insecure cookie handling for non-sensitive cookies\r\n* CSRF for Login or Logout\r\n* Password reset tokens don’t expire when changing email address\r\n* Email address change doesn’t require verification\r\n* Tab nabbing\r\n* Issues with the SPF, DKIM or DMARC records on shopify.com or other Shopify domains (sometimes reported as email spoofing)\r\n* Insecure “Opening Soon” password\r\n* Reflected XSS that requires full control of a http header, such as Referer, Host, etc.\r\n* User enumeration\r\n* CSV / formula injection\r\n* Hyperlink injection\r\n\r\n#Ineligible vulnerability types\r\nShopify does not consider the following to be eligible vulnerabilities under this program:\r\n* Denial of Service\r\n* Social Engineering, including phishing\r\n* Content spoofing\r\n* Vulnerabilities in other Shopify Inc. web sites or applications\r\n* Failure to implement security best practices such as rate limiting, minimum password strength, and mobile binary protection\r\n* Some server configuration issues\r\n* Any issue in a mobile application that can only be exploited on a rooted or jailbroken device, that depends on physical access to the device or debug access being enabled, or that depends on a vulnerability in the operating system.\r\n* Architectural decisions knowingly made by Shopify are not considered as valid submissions to the whitehat program even if there may be a more secure alternative configuration. For example, reporting that www.shopify.com is not using the https protocol will fall in this category. In general, issues that fall in this category will be rejected if we do not plan to implement a fix for them.\r\n\r\n#Rules for participation\r\nThe following rules must be followed in order for any rewards to be paid:\r\n* You may only test against shops you have created\r\n* You must not attempt to gain access to, or interact with, any shops other than those created by you\r\n* Rules for reporting must be followed\r\n* This program is not open to minors, individuals on sanctions lists or individuals in countries on sanctions lists\r\n* Allow a reasonable amount of time for Shopify to respond to your vulnerability report before publishing details of your exploit\r\n* Shopify reserves the right to modify the rules for this program or deem any submissions invalid at any time. Shopify may cancel the Whitehat program without notice at any time.\r\n\r\n#Reward Level\r\nThe rewards for the Shopify whitehat program start at $500 and will escalate based on severity.  \r\n\r\n#Indemnification\r\nShopify will not pursue legal action against security researchers who follow the guidelines outlined in this document and responsibly disclose vulnerabilities to us.","policy_html":"\u003ch1 id=\"introduction\"\u003eIntroduction\u003c/h1\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eShopify\u0026#39;s Whitehat program is our way to reward security researchers for finding serious security vulnerabilities in our core application, Shopify.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch1 id=\"participation\"\u003eParticipation\u003c/h1\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eWe encourage security researchers to sign up for a whitehat partner account, which you can use to create shops and private Shopify apps to use for testing within the testing guidelines. \u003ca title=\"https://app.shopify.com/services/partners/signup/whitehat\" href=\"https://app.shopify.com/services/partners/signup/whitehat\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\"\u003e\u003cspan\u003ehttps://app.shopify.com/services/partners/signup/whitehat\u003c/span\u003e\u003ci class=\"icon-external-link\"\u003e\u003c/i\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003ePlease use your Whitehat partner account to create shops for testing or add +hackerone to your email address, (e.g. \u003ca title=\"john.doe+hackerone@shopify.com\" href=\"mailto:john.doe+hackerone@shopify.com\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\"\u003ejohn.doe+hackerone@shopify.com\u003c/a\u003e) so we can properly identify your shop.

Our security team reviews all vulnerability reports and acts upon them in accordance with responsible disclosure. As a general rule, we will acknowledge your submission within 30 days - usually in a lot less time - and address findings within 90 days.\r\n\r\n## Scope\r\n\r\nThis program is limited to **Snapchat**’s applications and websites listed below:\r\n\r\n### Core applications and websites:\r\n- **Snapchat**’s current mobile application for IOS ([here](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/snapchat/id447188370?mt=8)) and Android ([here](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.snapchat.android)).\r\n- **Snapchat**’s main server-side application hosted on Google App Engine under the hostname feelinsonice-hrd.appspot.com and app.snapchat.com.\r\n- **Snapchat**’s new (limited) account management website hosted on https://accounts.snapchat.com. \r\n- **Snapchat**’s  on-demand Geofilters purchase website hosted on https://geofilters.snapchat.com. (Added Aug 16, 2016)\r\n\r\nThe mostly static support website hosted on https://support.snapchat.com/ is not in scope.\r\n\r\n### Non-core website(s):\r\n- www.scan.me\r\n- https://www.bitmoji.com (Added Aug 16, 2016)\r\n- https://www.bitstrips.com (Added Aug 16, 2016)\r\n- Bitstrips current mobile application for IOS ([here](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/bitmoji-keyboard-your-avatar/id868077558)) and Android ([here](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.bitstrips.imoji)). (Added Aug 16, 2016)\r\n\r\nWe expect to expand the scope of the program in the following weeks and months to cover additional components of our production systems.\r\n\r\n## Eligibility\r\n\r\nTo qualify for a reward under this program, you must:\r\n- Be the first to report a specific vulnerability.\r\n- Send a clear textual description of the report along with steps to reproduce the vulnerability. Include attachments such as screenshots or proof of concept code as necessary.\r\n- Disclose the vulnerability report responsibly to us. Public disclosure or disclosure to other third parties - including vulnerability brokers - before we addressed your report forfeit the reward.\r\n- Demonstrate care in reproducing the vulnerability. In particular, test only on accounts you own and do not attempt to view or tamper with data belonging to others.\r\n\r\n## Rewards\r\n\r\nWe will reward reports according to their severity on a case-by-case basis as determined by our security team. We may pay more for unique, hard-to-find bugs; we may also pay less for bugs with complex prerequisites that lower risk of exploitation. Our minimum reward is $250 USD.\r\n\r\nWe are particularly interested in the following categories of security bugs. Here are the current minimum payments for each:\r\n\r\n| Vulnerability        | Minimum[1]           |\r\n| ------------- |:-------------:|\r\n| Server-Side Remote Code Execution (e.g. command injection)      | $15,000 |\r\n| Significant Authentication Bypass / Logic Flaw      | $7,500      |\r\n| Unrestricted File System Access | $5,000      |\r\n| XSS or XSRF With Significant Security Impact | $2,000      |\r\n\r\n[1] Note that these minimums are for Snapchat’s core applications and websites as listed in the “Scope” section above. Bounties for non-core websites may vary and be lower than the minimums listed in this table. This depends on the nature of the non-core website and is subject to the discretion of the reward panel. For example, if a non-core website is going to be deprecated, a bug in this non-core website may be considered to be lower priority than a bug in our core applications or websites as listed above. This will be reflected in the bounty amount.\r\n\r\n## Non-qualifying vulnerabilities and exclusions\r\n\r\n- Social engineering attempts on our staff including phishing emails\r\n- Attempts to access our offices or data centers\r\n- Vulnerabilities in a vendor we integrate with\r\n- Use of automated tools that could generate significant traffic and possibly impair the functioning of our application\r\n- Reports solely indicating a lack of a possible security defense such as certificate pinning. We constantly make security improvements to our product offering.\r\n- Screenshot detection avoidance. This exclusion may be lifted under reasonable constraints in the future.\r\n- Two-factor authentication bypass that requires physical access to a logged-in device.\r\n- Scan's mobile and desktop applications are not currently in scope.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, the following reports do not qualify for a reward:\r\n- Lack of email address verification during account registration. We are currently making improvements to our registration flow.\r\n- Local access to user data when operating a rooted mobile device.\r\n- Tampering with the host header in the request and receiving a redirect to a safe domain.

We provide products and services that millions around the world use every day, and understand privacy and security is very important to our customers.\r\n\r\n# Reward Program\r\nTo honor the Ubiquiti advocates that provide research and contributions to help improve security for our products, we provide a Security Reward Program. This program allows Ubiquiti to continuously improve the security of our products, while publicly recognizing the security enthusiasts submitting valid issues.\r\n\r\nIf you believe you have found a vulnerability in any of Ubiquiti's products or services, let us know as soon as possible, and we'll do our best to get the issues addressed as quickly as possible.\r\n\r\n#Program Scope\r\nThe Security Reward Program encompasses all of Ubiquiti's products. Including, but not limited to:\r\n\r\n###Web Products\r\n* *.ubnt.com -- any web applications under ubnt.com domain (WWW, SSO Account, etc), except: Store, Community and Forums.\r\n* Cloud applications (excluding aircrm.ubnt.com)\r\n* NOTE: Sites on a *.ubnt.com domain but hosted with another provider may not be in scope (e.g. ir.ubnt.com)\r\n\r\n###Platform Products\r\n* airMAX, UniFi, UniFi-Video, EdgeMAX, and airFiber embedded devices \r\n* Distributed Software Platforms -- Any controller software: UniFi, UniFi-Video, airControl\r\n-- Note that mFi is Out of Scope!\r\n\r\nWe consider a Vulnerability to be an error, flaw, mistake, failure or fault in a computer program or system that impacts the security of a device, system, network or data. In general, any Vulnerability may be considered for this Program. Please see exceptions below.\r\n\r\nAny products or areas of our site that are based on other software platforms are not eligible for bounties for bugs fixed in the platform's latest releases until at least one month after the platform's release. \r\n\r\n#Rewards\r\nRewards typically range anywhere from US$100 - $25,000 depending on the application and the risk, complexity, impact and overall severity of the Vulnerability. Some examples include:\r\n\r\n* Remote code execution\r\n* Authentication bypass, unauthorized data access\r\n* SQL injection\r\n* XSS, XSRF, CSRF\r\n\r\n**At this time we are not offering rewards for clickjacking!**\r\n\r\nOur reward panel will review each Vulnerability submission for eligibility and final reward consideration. Final reward amounts are at the sole and final discretion of Ubiquiti's reward panel. In some instances, our reward panel may choose higher rewards for unusually major, clever or complex Vulnerability submissions.\r\n\r\nAll reward payments are subject to compliance with local laws, rules and regulations. Before you receive your reward, we may require that you sign an affidavit of eligibility, a questionnaire, and a release of liability. You will be solely responsible for all applicable taxes relating to any reward under this Program.\r\n\r\n#Recognition\r\nUbiquiti may publish a leaderboard of Vulnerability reporters based on previous security vulnerability and bug reports. These previous reporters may receive special access to Ubiquiti engineers.

Our minimum reward is currently **$128 USD**, and we expect to pay **$1024+** for major vulnerabilities.\r\n\r\nTo qualify for a bounty you must:\r\n\r\n - Report a **qualifying vulnerability** (see below) that is **in the scope of our program** (also below)\r\n - Be the first person to report the vulnerability\r\n - Adhere to our disclosure guidelines (see above)\r\n - Only test against your own accounts and data\r\n - Refrain from disclosing the vulnerability until we've addressed it\r\n - Be in a country where we can legally pay you (e.g. we can't if you're a resident of North Korea)\r\n - Communicate with our security team exclusively via HackerOne (the security team will be _way_ more impressed by your exploits than our support or social media teams)\r\n\r\nWe may sometimes choose to award bounties that are less than our stated minimum; these are generally given to researchers who file informative reports that don't warrant a change.\r\n\r\n## Scope\r\n\r\nVulnerabilities affecting the following domains are in scope and may qualify for a bounty:\r\n\r\n - trello.com\r\n - api.trello.com\r\n - *.trello.services\r\n\r\nVulnerabilities affecting blog.trello.com will only qualify for a bounty if they include a working proof of concept showing how the issue can compromise user data on trello.com.\r\n\r\nOther domains (e.g. trello-attachments.s3.amazonaws.com) or subdomains not listed above (e.g. e.trello.com, help.trello.com) are *not* in scope and will not qualify for a bounty.\r\n\r\n## Reports must include the following:\r\n\r\n - A Proof of Concept\r\n - Detailed steps on how to reproduce the vulnerability\r\n - Explanation of how the attack could be executed in a **real world scenario** to compromise user accounts or data\r\n\r\n## Qualifying Vulnerabilities\r\n\r\nExamples of qualifying vulnerabilities likely to be eligible for a bounty include:\r\n\r\n - Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) [affecting a browser supported by Trello](https://trello.com/platforms)\r\n - Cross-Site Request Forgery (XSRF)\r\n - Missing/Broken Authentication\r\n - Remote Code Execution\r\n - Privilege Escalation\r\n - SQL Injection ;)\r\n\r\nOur security team will assess all submissions and determine if they qualify for a bounty.\r\n\r\n## Non-Qualifying Issues\r\n\r\nNot all issues are in the scope of our program, including some issues that may have been accepted by other programs.  We don't want you to waste time submitting a report that won't qualify, so please be aware of these non-qualifying issues before beginning your research and submitting any reports.\r\n\r\nExamples of non-qualifying vulnerabilities (not eligible for a bounty) include:\r\n\r\n - Reports from automated tools or scanners\r\n - Theoretical attacks without actual proof of exploitability\r\n - Denial of Service attacks\r\n - Brute force attacks (e.g. on passwords or tokens)\r\n - Username or email address enumeration\r\n - Spamming\r\n - Issues with third-party applications (e.g. tools that interact with Trello or the Trello API, Chrome Extensions)\r\n - Issues with domains not owned by Trello Inc (see the scope above)\r\n - Social engineering of Trello staff or users (e.g. phishing)\r\n - Vulnerabilities obtained through compromising Trello user or employee accounts\r\n - Attacks involving any user accounts not created by you\r\n - Physical attacks against Trello Inc offices or data centers\r\n - Attacks involving physical access to a user's device, or involving a device or network that is already seriously compromised (e.g. man-in-the-middle attacks)\r\n - Missing security headers that do not lead directly to a vulnerability\r\n - Clickjacking and \"Tabnabbing\" (i.e. reports involving manipulation of `window.opener`)\r\n - Content Spoofing and \"hyperlink injection\" (in emails)\r\n - Cookies missing secure/httponly\r\n - Bugs that rely on an unlikely user interaction (i.e. the user effectively attacking themselves)\r\n - Issues related to password and account recovery policies (e.g. password complexity requirements)\r\n - Issues related to board and organization invitation policies\r\n - Issues related to having autocomplete enabled (i.e. not explicitly disabled) on password inputs\r\n - Disclosure of tools, libraries used by Trello and/or their versions\r\n - Open redirects on domains other than trello.com\r\n - Issues that are the result of a user doing something silly (like sharing their password or API tokens publicly)\r\n - Attacks affecting browsers not [explicitly supported by Trello](https://trello.com/platforms)\r\n - Issues related to e-mail coming from @trello.com addresses (e.g. things related to DMARC and SPF)\r\n - Reports of third party services and libraries needing to be updated to address a potential vulnerability … unless the updated version has been available for more than 48 hours\r\n\r\nIf you discover an out-of-scope bug in Trello while looking for security issues, you can report it to us by emailing our support team at \u003csupport@trello.com\u003e.

Bugs in Dropbox Paper are also eligible. No other applications (including acquisitions) are in the scope of this program.\r\n\r\n# Eligibility and Responsible Disclosure\r\n\r\nYou are responsible for complying with any applicable laws, and you should only use your own accounts or test accounts for reporting vulnerabilities. \r\n\r\nTo promote the discovery and reporting of vulnerabilities and increase user safety, we ask that you:\r\n- Share the security issue with us in detail\r\n- Give us a reasonable time to respond to the issue before making any information about it public.\r\n- Not access or modify data without explicit permission of the owner.\r\n- Act in good faith not to degrade the performance of our services (including denial of service).\r\n\r\nWe only reward the first reporter of a vulnerability. Public disclosure of the vulnerability prior to resolution will result in disqualification from the program. You must report a qualifying vulnerability through the HackerOne reporting tool to be eligible for a monetary reward.  \r\n\r\n# Out-of-scope Vulnerabilities\r\n\r\nAll acquisition reports are out of scope for this program.\r\n\r\nThe following issues are outside the scope of our rewards program:\r\n- Our policies on presence/absence of SPF/DMARC records\r\n- Password, email and account policies, such as email id verification, reset link expiration, password complexity\r\n- Lack of CSRF tokens (unless there is evidence of actual, sensitive user action not protected by a token)\r\n- Login/logout CSRF\r\n- Attacks requiring physical access to a user's device\r\n- Missing security headers which do not lead directly to a vulnerability\r\n- Missing best practices (we require evidence of a security vulnerability)\r\n- Hosting malware/arbitrary content on Dropbox and causing downloads\r\n- XSS on dropboxusercontent.com is out of scope\r\n- Self-XSS (we require evidence on how the XSS can be used to attack another Dropbox user)\r\n- XSS on any site other than www.dropbox.com. \r\n- We will accept reports of XSS on dropbox.com subdomains but will not reward for them. \r\n- dropboxforums.com XSS is also out of scope\r\n- Host header injections unless you can show how they can lead to stealing user data.\r\n- Use of a known-vulnerable library (without evidence of exploitability)\r\n- Issues related to software or protocols not under Dropbox control\r\n- Reports from automated tools or scans\r\n- Reports of spam (i.e., any report involving ability to send emails without rate limits)\r\n- Bypass of malware detection\r\n- Attacks that require attacker app to have the permission to overlay on top of our app (e.g., tapjacking)\r\n- Vulnerabilities affecting users of outdated browsers or platforms\r\n- Social engineering of Dropbox employees or contractors\r\n- Any physical attempts against Dropbox property or data centers\r\n- Presence of autocomplete attribute on web forms\r\n- Missing cookie flags on non-sensitive cookies\r\n- Reports of insecure SSL/TLS ciphers (unless you have a working proof of concept, and not just a report from a scanner)\r\n- Any report that discusses how you can learn whether a given username, email address has a Dropbox account.\r\n- Any access to data where the targeted user needs to be operating a rooted mobile device.\r\n- Any report on bypassing our storage limits etc is out of scope\r\n- Any report about DLL hijacking without demonstrating how it gains new privileges is also out of scope.\r\n- Any report about how Dropbox can be used to serve malware (we have separate rate limits and malware detection systems for those that prevent attacks at scale.)\r\n- We will only accept critical reports in blogs.dropbox.com (e.g., RCE). Minor issues that can't impact Dropbox users are out of scope. Please report them to the [Automattic Program](https://hackerone.com/automattic).\r\n- Content spoofing vulnerabilities (where you can only inject text or an image into a page) are out of scope. We will accept and resolve  a spoofing vulnerability where attacker can inject image or rich text (HTML), but it is not eligible for a bounty. Pure text injection is out of scope.\r\n- Ability to share links without verifying email.\r\n- Absence of rate limiting, unless related to authentication\r\n- Reflected File Download vulnerabilities or any vulnerabilities that let you start a download to the user's computer are out of scope.\r\n- IP/Port Scanning via Dropbox services unless you are able to hit private IP or Dropbox servers.\r\n- Devices (ios, android, desktop apps) not getting unlinked on password change. \r\n- Hyperlink injection or any link injection in emails we send.\r\n- Creating multiple account using same email is also out of scope.\r\n\r\nHere's a note on [best practices for submitting a report](https://blogs.dropbox.com/tech/2015/08/dropbox-bug-bounty-program-best-practices-2/)\r\n\r\n# The Fine Print\r\n\r\nYou are responsible for paying any taxes associated with rewards.

{"id":361,"name":"WordPoints","handle":"wordpoints","url":"https://hackerone.com/wordpoints","profile":{"name":"WordPoints","twitter_handle":"","website":"","about":"Open source points plugin for WordPress."},"policy":"# Scope\r\nI'm interested in **source code vulnerabilities** in the targets listed below.\r\n\r\n# The Targets\r\nIn order of importance:\r\n- The [WordPoints plugin](https://wordpress.org/plugins/wordpoints/) ([developed on GitHub](https://github.com/WordPoints/wordpoints/)).\r\n- Extensions for the plugin (called \"modules\") developed under [the WordPoints organization on GitHub](https://github.com/WordPoints/).\r\n\r\nPlease note that at present **the wordpoints.org website is *not* considered a valid target**.\r\n\r\n# Important Notes\r\n- The plugin and many of the modules are developed with the production code in the `/src` directory of the repository. In these cases, **only code within the `/src` directory is in scope**, since only that code is distributed and installed. This is only important when you're looking at one of the development branches. You can also download the code for the latest release (e.g., for [WordPoints](https://github.com/WordPoints/wordpoints/releases/latest)), and in that case, the package will only contain the production code.\r\n- I do not maintain old branches of the code, so **only vulnerabilities present in the development version and the latest release are in scope**. On GitHub these will be the `master` branch and the highest number `x.x` branch, respectively.\r\n\r\n# Reporting Bugs\r\nWhen reporting a vulnerability, please include a POC if possible. That will help us to validate the report as quickly as possible, and will also save you from reporting false bugs.\r\n\r\n# Bounty Program\r\nWe offer small bounties for valid bugs. We may award larger bounties if we think the bug is more serious.\r\n\r\n# Invalid Bugs\r\n- **Path Disclosure:** That's really a server issue, and any competent admin will have `display_errors` disabled on production boxes.\r\n\r\n- **Directory Listing:** Similar to path disclosure, this isn't really a concern. Many of the projects are open source, so an attacker can already easily determine the directory structure. Only if a directory is created after the plugin/module is installed would there be any concern of sensitive information being disclosed.\r\n\r\n- **Version Disclosure:** Hiding the names or versions of software that a service is running is just security through obscurity.\r\n\r\n- **XSS:** Reports of XSS vulnerabilities are welcome. However, [in WordPress some user Roles are trusted and are allowed to post unfiltered HTML](http://codex.wordpress.org/FAQ_Security#Why_are_some_users_allowed_to_post_unfiltered_HTML.3F) on the front end of the site. An XSS vulnerability may not be considered valid if it can only be exploited by users who have the `unfiltered_html` capability, and if it does not affect the administration panels. If you're unsure whether an XSS bug is valid, please report it anyway.\r\n\r\n- **Nonce Persistence:** WordPress uses CSRF tokens called \"nonces\". However, unlike true nonces, they aren't used only once, but [expire after a limited time](http://codex.wordpress.org/WordPress_Nonces#Nonce_lifetime). If you see the same nonce token value being used repeatedly, that is probably why.\r\n\r\n- **Nonces in `GET` requests:** The WordPress developers have built the nonce system to be fairly robust against leaking of nonces in `GET` requests. WordPress actually includes a function for adding a nonce as a `GET` parameter to a URL, [wp_nonce_url()](https://developer.wordpress.org/reference/functions/wp_nonce_url/). This is generally considered an excepted risk. If you think that a particular case of using an nonce in a `GET` request poses a significant risk, please report it anyway.\r\n\r\n- **File Uploads:** WordPoints allows users with sufficient capabilities to upload arbitrary files to the server. We are only interested in vulnerabilities related to file uploads if they can be exploited by users who do not have the `install_modules` capability.\r\n\r\n- **Outside Scope:** Only source code bugs are within scope; vulnerabilities at the server or network layer are not in scope.\r\n\r\n- **Invalid targets:** The wordpoints.org website is not a valid target. Please see the Targets section above for a list of valid targets. \r\n","policy_html":"\u003ch1 id=\"scope\"\u003eScope\u003c/h1\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eI\u0026#39;m interested in \u003cstrong\u003esource code vulnerabilities\u003c/strong\u003e in the targets listed below.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch1 id=\"the-targets\"\u003eThe Targets\u003c/h1\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eIn order of importance:\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eThe \u003ca href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/wordpoints/\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\"\u003e\u003cspan\u003eWordPoints plugin\u003c/span\u003e\u003ci class=\"icon-external-link\"\u003e\u003c/i\u003e\u003c/a\u003e (\u003ca href=\"https://github.com/WordPoints/wordpoints/\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\"\u003e\u003cspan\u003edeveloped on GitHub\u003c/span\u003e\u003ci class=\"icon-external-link\"\u003e\u003c/i\u003e\u003c/a\u003e).\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eExtensions for the plugin (called \u0026quot;modules\u0026quot;) developed under \u003ca href=\"https://github.com/WordPoints/\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\"\u003e\u003cspan\u003ethe WordPoints organization on GitHub\u003c/span\u003e\u003ci class=\"icon-external-link\"\u003e\u003c/i\u003e\u003c/a\u003e.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003ePlease note that at present \u003cstrong\u003ethe wordpoints.org website is \u003cem\u003enot\u003c/em\u003e considered a valid target\u003c/strong\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch1 id=\"important-notes\"\u003eImportant Notes\u003c/h1\u003e\n\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eThe plugin and many of the modules are developed with the production code in the \u003ccode\u003e/src\u003c/code\u003e directory of the repository.

If valuable, please include any screenshots, links you clicked on, pages visited, etc. \r\n* Describe the versions of all relevant components of the attack (eg browser, OS, mobile app version).\r\n* Describe a concrete attack scenario. How will the problem impact Square or Square buyers/sellers? Put the problem into context.\r\n\r\n\u0026nbsp;\r\n#Scope\r\nWe welcome you to report problems related to the following web domains:\r\n* [*.squareup.com](https://squareup.com/)\r\n* [*.square.com](https://square.com)\r\n* [*.cash.me](https://cash.me)\r\n\r\n\u0026nbsp;\r\nOur Android and iOS mobile applications for Square Cash and Square Register are also in scope:\r\n* https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/square-register-accept-credit/id335393788\r\n* https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/square-cash/id711923939\r\n* https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.squareup\r\n* https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.squareup.cash\r\n\r\n\u0026nbsp;\r\n# Keep in mind that:\r\n* We also have a bounty program for our open source code: https://hackerone.com/square-open-source\r\n\r\n\u0026nbsp;\r\n# Special CTF-style Flags!\r\n## Find the account\r\nWe've created an account with an email address of the form `ftwr+[32 character flag]@squareup.com`.  Tell us how you found it, and you'll get a $1000 bounty. In case it helps, you can find the associated Square Market page [here](https://squareup.com/market/hackerone-flag-in-email-account).\r\n\r\nThe SHA1 digest of the flag is: `b9559723b3fd537e368fdc5c221eef72dc2e8adc`. \r\n\r\n## Find the file\r\nFind a file called `hackerone-flag.txt` with the contents of the form `ftwr+[32 character flag]`. Tell us how you found it, and you'll get a $1000 bounty. \r\n\r\nThe SHA1 digest of the flag is: `1fb27653e08cef9c6acdd520f2e9398ad3576549`.\r\n\r\n## Computing the sha1\r\nTo make sure you know that you have found the right flag, we are publishing the digests of the flags by running `echo [32 characters] | sha1sum`. You can do the same on your terminal (you might need to install `sha1sum` or use an alternate method).\r\nFor example, if the value of the token were `fb3f8fe63cc107c1977855c95633fb13` (it's not), then you would get:\r\n\r\n```\r\n~ echo -n fb3f8fe63cc107c1977855c95633fb13 | sha1sum\r\n53aa4d47f93b76214834193baefb9c6e7d042c11  -\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Rules\r\nSome things to keep in mind when hunting for flags:\r\n\r\n* Only flags created by Square are eligible for the reward.  There will be at most one reward per flag.\r\n* Only the first person to report a flag and methodology for discovery will be rewarded.\r\n* The flags are long enough that brute force won't work.  You'll have to be more creative!\r\n\r\n\u0026nbsp;\r\n# Ineligible reports\r\n* Issues related to software not under Square's control\r\n\r\nThis includes issues of CSV \"injection\" in Excel. [This write-up from Google echos our thoughts.](https://sites.google.com/site/bughunteruniversity/nonvuln/csv-excel-formula-injection)\r\n\r\n* Reports from automated tools or scans\r\n* Social engineering of Square staff or contractors\r\n* Any physical attempts against Square property or data centers\r\n* Self-XSS\r\n* Logout CSRF\r\n* Presence of autocomplete attribute on web forms\r\n* Missing cookie flags on non-sensitive cookies\r\n* Missing http security headers (unless you deliver a proof of concept that leverages their absence)\r\n* Clickjacking on widgets intended to be embedded in other pages\r\n* Reports of insecure SSL/TLS ciphers (unless you have a working proof of concept, and not just a report from a scanner)\r\n* No maximum password length\r\n* An oracle that discloses whether a given username, email address, or phone number is associated with an actual account.  (However, please do submit anything that allows you to recover usernames en masse.)\r\n* Using spoofed emails for phishing\r\n* Brute forcing of password reset token for squareup.com (unless you can deliver a proof of concept that bypasses throttling *and* an arbitrary/blind iteration)\r\n* Reports of the 2-factor token not expiring.

{"id":265,"name":"ExpressionEngine","handle":"expressionengine","url":"https://hackerone.com/expressionengine","profile":{"name":"ExpressionEngine","twitter_handle":"ellislab","website":"http://ellislab.com/expressionengine","about":"ExpressionEngine is a robust and flexible Content Management System."},"policy":"**PLEASE NOTE:** *This program is for the downloadable self-hosted application [ExpressionEngine](https://store.ellislab.com/), _not_ the EllisLab.com web site. Reports will not be considered that are the result of scans or intrusion attempts of the web site, and such activity is a violation of our web site's terms of use.*\r\n\r\nWe take security issues very seriously, and encourage responsible reporting with a high priority on making security fixes or patches available rapidly, prior to any public disclosure of the vulnerability. We find this is the best balance of giving security issues the attention they rightly deserve, and protecting end users and site visitors from malicious individuals and script kiddies.\r\n\r\nAll software has vulnerabilities, but when we work together with developers and researchers, we can all help make the Internet a safer and better place. We love to acknowledge researchers who make valid security reports and work with us, and while we do not have a bounty program, sometimes will donate software or swag for being classy.\r\n\r\n## What are Security Issues?\r\n\r\nWhen we speak about security related bugs, we are most interested in:\r\n\r\n-   [Cross-site Scripting (XSS)](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-site_Scripting)\r\n-   [Cross-site Request Forgery (CSRF)](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-site_request_forgery)\r\n-   [Privilege Escalation](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Privilege_escalation)\r\n-   [Session Hijacking](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Session_hijacking)\r\n-   [Arbitrary Code Execution](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arbitrary_code_execution)\r\n\r\n## Making Good Security Reports\r\n\r\nWe don’t have rigid guidelines for what a security bug report should include, as we want to minimize barriers—ultimately we just want to receive the information. That said, the best security reports not only describe the vulnerability, but include a proof of concept as well as how it might be exploited in a realistic situation. Bonus points for including your recommended solution.\r\n\r\nOn the converse, security reports that are merely the output of penetration testing software are generally not only unhelpful, but typically contain false-positives as the software cannot grasp the context or implications of a piece of code that checks off one of the items on the vendor’s preset list of vulnerabilities.\r\n\r\nSince our team only speaks English all security reports must be made in English, and communication will be in that language.\r\n\r\n## Reporting and Disclosure\r\n\r\nOnce you have reported the security issue, a number of steps will be taken to assess and address the reported issue prior to disclosure.\r\n\r\n- The report will be triaged within 48 hours to determine if the issue is a legitimate security issue. Issues reported on weekends or U.S. holidays may take 72–96 hours to be triaged.\r\n- Immediately after being triaged, an engineer will be assigned as the owner of the issue and will contact you regarding your report.\r\n- If confirmed, the engineer will set to work on resolving the issue, providing the reporter with a patch to test the prospective fix.\r\n- We try to have all security issues fixed within two weeks of being triaged, often much more quickly.

Our public staging server runs the same code as production. Create as many test accounts there as you feel necessary; **actual customer data is strongly discouraged** for exploits — a reproduce case will suffice. One report to cover both domains is sufficient; please perform testing against `stage.wepay.com` to prevent service interruption to our customers.\r\n\r\nVulnerabilities that may be specific to server configs (SSL settings, etc) may also be tested on `www.wepay.com` and `wepayapi.com`, as the environments may be configured differently.\r\n\r\n## Attributes of a good report:\r\n1. Only one issue per report.\r\n2. Summarize the Security issue in a single sentence\r\n3. Describe detailed steps for reproducing the bug. If possible, please include video or screenshots, links you clicked on, pages visited, etc.\r\n4. Elaborate Security implications of the issue. How will the problem affect WePay, our users or our partners? What's the worst thing that could happen if an attacker takes advantage of this security flaw.\r\n\r\n\u003e **Functioning exploits are worth more money than reports that are copy-pasted from other security-related websites.** A screenshot is much less useful than a video, and a functioning exploit will *always* have real code. *Showing* that there's a potential issue is less valuable than *exploiting* a real issue.\r\n\r\n\r\n## With Regard to Duplicates\r\n\r\nIf we have already received a report of a similar issue, which we believe would be resolved by the same fix that would resolve your issue, then we will mark your issue as a _duplicate_ because the _root-cause_ is the same.\r\n\r\n## With Regard to Reputation\r\n\r\nIf you make an effort to file a legitimate issue, and it is not necessarily a valid issue, we will generally close it as *Informational* (+0) — UNLESS it is clear that you made no effort to read these Guidelines, in which case we may choose to close as *Not Applicable* (-5) if the case is particularly egregious.\r\n\r\n### Following categories of issues will be marked N/A:\r\n\r\n* Copy-pasting reports from another site or submitting reports, without providing any evidence that the vulnerability actually exists.\r\n* Issues for domains listed in Out-of-scope domains section\r\n* Issues mentioned under out-of-scope vulnerabilities.\r\n\r\n## Scope\r\n\r\n\"Typical\" web vulnerabilities are generally considered in-scope.

If we determine that your report is exceptional and is bounty-worthy, it will be paid-out from the bottom-end of the reward scale.\r\n\r\n## Automated Scanning\r\n\r\nIf you employ automated scanning tools, their requests **must** be rate limited to not exceed 3 requests per second without prior approval. Failure to do so may be considered a DoS attack and will result in disqualification from the program.\r\n\r\nAutomated vulnerability scanners commonly have low priority issues and/or false positives. Before submitting the results from a scanner, please take a moment to confirm that the reported issues are actually valid and exploitable. Please submit an issue only if you have exploited a real vulnerability (see Scope Exclusions, below)\r\n\r\n## Eligibility and Responsible Disclosure\r\n\r\nYou will qualify for bounty eligibility only if you are the first person to responsibly disclose an unknown issue. We intend to respond and resolve reported issues as quickly as possible, but please allow up to 14 days for a response and 90–120 days for a resolution (if we expect resolution to take longer, we will be upfront about this).\r\n\r\nIssues not disclosed through HackerOne or by directly emailing \u003csecurity@wepay.com\u003e are ineligible and may result in removal from the program.\r\n\r\n## Tools\r\n\r\nZero members of our staff use Microsoft Windows, so videos which use Windows-specific tools are not helpful for reproducing issues. Videos should contain steps that can be reproduced without leveraging features that are specific to a single tool that is only available for Microsoft Windows.\r\n\r\nWe use Linux or OS X for everything. If your functioning exploit leverages a command-line tool, it should be a tool which works on OS X (Darwin), RedHat-based Linuxes (e.g., RHEL, CentOS) or Debian-based Linuxes (e.g., Debian, Ubuntu). If your functioning exploit leverages a GUI tool, it should be a tool which works on OS X.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Videos\r\n\r\nPlease use **modern** codecs and containers when submitting videos.\r\n\r\n* **H.264** video + **AAC** audio + **MP4** container is overwhelmingly preferred.\r\n* Non-Standardized codecs and containers (e.g., VP8, VP9, MKV, WebM, Ogg) are not preferred, but still acceptable.\r\n* Outdated codecs and containers (e.g., Microsoft Video 1, VC-1, AVI, WMV, FLV, H.263, Theora, VP6, VP7) is discouraged.\r\n\r\n","policy_html":"\u003ch1 id=\"wepay-bug-bounty-program-rules\"\u003eWePay Bug Bounty Program Rules\u003c/h1\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eWePay asks that tests are performed against \u003ccode\u003estage-go.wepay.com\u003c/code\u003e, \u003ccode\u003estage.wepay.com\u003c/code\u003e and \u003ccode\u003estage.wepayapi.com\u003c/code\u003e.

{"id":61,"name":"Twitter","handle":"twitter","url":"https://hackerone.com/twitter","profile":{"name":"Twitter","twitter_handle":"twittersecurity","website":"https://twitter.com","about":"Twitter helps you create and share ideas and information instantly, without barriers."},"policy":"# Program Rules\r\n\r\nMaintaining top-notch security online is a community effort, and we’re lucky to have a vibrant group of independent security researchers who volunteer their time to help us spot potential issues. To recognize their efforts and the important role they play in keeping Twitter safe for everyone we offer a bounty for reporting certain qualifying security vulnerabilities.  Please review the following program rules before you report a vulnerability.  By participating in this program, you agree to be bound by these rules.\r\n\r\n## Rewards\r\n\r\nTwitter may provide rewards to eligible reporters of qualifying vulnerabilities. Our minimum reward is $140 USD.  There is no maximum reward. Rewards are paid out on Fridays. The following table outlines the usual minimum rewards for specific classes of vulnerabilities for in-scope properties (see section on Scope). \r\n\r\n|Vulnerability | Core Twitter [1]| All Other |\r\n------------- | -------------| -------------|\r\n|Remote Code Execution | $15,000| $10,000|\r\n|Significant Authentication Bypass [6] | $7,500| $5,000|\r\n|Cross Site Scripting that can perform critical actions [2] [3] [4] [5] | $2,500| $1,500|\r\n|Cross Site Request Forgery on critical actions [2] [4]| $2,500| $1,500|\r\n|All other Cross Site Scripting [3] [4]| $1,000| $500|\r\n|All other Cross Site Request Forgery [4] | $280| $140|\r\n||||\r\n\r\n*[1] Core Twitter covers twitter.com, Twitter for iOS, Twitter for Android and reports permitting takeover of a Twitter account.*\r\n*[2] Critical actions include (but are not limited to) tweeting, retweeting, favoriting and direct messaging.*\r\n*[3] Excluding self-XSS.*\r\n*[4] Divide by half of the All Other amount for MoPub properties*\r\n*[5] Divide by half for XSS blocked by Content-Security-Policy settings*\r\n*[6] Divide by half for issues that require the attacker to interact with the user*\r\n\r\nTwitter will determine in its discretion whether a reward should be granted and the amount of the reward - in particular we may choose to pay higher rewards for unusually clever or severe vulnerabilities or lower rewards for vulnerabilities that require significant or unusual user interaction. This is not a contest or competition. Rewards may be provided on an ongoing basis so long as this program is active.\r\n\r\n## Scope\r\n\r\nThe following sites and applications are in scope for this program:\r\n* *.twitter.com\r\n* vine.co\r\n* periscope.tv\r\n* MoPub\r\n* ZeroPush\r\n* Twitter for iOS / Android\r\n* Vine Camera\r\n* Periscope for iOS / Android\r\n\r\nVulnerabilities reported on other Twitter properties or applications are currently not eligible for monetary rewards (as they come into scope, they will be added to this section). However, they are still eligible for our [Hall of Fame](https://hackerone.com/twitter/thanks). High impact vulnerabilities will be considered on a case by case basis.\r\n\r\n## Reporting Possible Vulnerabilities\r\n\r\nYou must report a qualifying vulnerability through the HackerOne reporting tool to be eligible for a monetary reward.\r\n\r\nIf you have an issue that affects only your own account such as unintended Tweets, DMs, or follows, abuse, harassment, spam, or phishing, please [find the appropriate form here](https://support.twitter.com/forms/).\r\n\r\nIf you are researching security issues, especially those which may compromise the privacy of others, please use test accounts in order to respect our users’ privacy. When demonstrating a vulnerability, please do so in an unobtrusive manner to avoid drawing public attention to the vulnerability. Vulnerabilities that are exposed publicly as a part of putting together a proof of concept (e.g. website defacement, stored XSS on a public site) are not eligible for bounty.\r\n\r\n**Report Template**\r\n\r\nPlease be aware that the quality of your report is critical to your submission. To ensure that we are able to understand what you are reporting and the potential impact, please make sure your report contains the following items. You might want to consider using this as a template or checklist when writing up your report. \r\n\r\n* What type of issue are you reporting? Does it align to a CWE or OWASP issue?\r\n* How does a user reproduce your issue? (If this contains more than a few steps, please create a video so we can attempt to perform the same steps).\r\n* What is the impact of your issue?\r\n* What are some scenarios where an attacker would be able to leverage this vulnerability?\r\n* What would be your suggested fix?\r\n\r\n## Eligibility and Responsible Disclosure\r\n\r\nWe are happy to thank everyone who submits valid reports which help us improve the security of Twitter!  However, only those that meet the following eligibility requirements may receive a monetary reward: \r\n\r\n* You must be the first reporter of a vulnerability. \r\n* The vulnerability must be a qualifying vulnerability (see below) associated with a site or application in scope (see above).\r\n* We can’t be legally prohibited from rewarding you (for example, you can’t be a resident of or located within Cuba, Sudan, North Korea, Iran or Syria, a national of other certain countries, or on a denied parties or sanctions list). \r\n* You may not publicly disclose the vulnerability prior to our resolution.\r\n\r\n## Qualifying Vulnerabilities\r\n\r\nAny design or implementation issue that is reproducible and substantially affects the security of Twitter users is likely to be in scope for the program. Common examples include:\r\n\r\n* Cross Site Scripting (XSS)\r\n* Cross Site Request Forgery (CSRF)\r\n* Remote Code Execution (RCE)\r\n* Unauthorized Access to Protected Tweets\r\n* Unauthorized Access to DMs\r\n\r\nWhen in doubt, consider what an attack scenario would look like.

This API is the main scope of this program.\r\n\r\n# SCOPE\r\nThe scope of this program focuses on the [REST API](http://docs.joolaio.apiary.io) exposed by joola. While we will **consider ANY security issue raised** by this program, we hold the below as our main focus points of concern.\r\n\r\n*[Read more about our API documentation](http://docs.joolaio.apiary.io)*\r\n\r\n**Token Authorization**\r\nEvery action carried out by joola has an associated security context. The context dictates what permissions and restrictions a user has within the system. This vector focuses on identifying scenarios in which a user can access a restricted API endpoint without a valid token or by impersonating another user.\r\n\r\n**REST API Execution Context**\r\nEach API action has a permission associated with it and a user may or may not have a permission to access the API endpoint. The second tier of security happens within the API endpoint itself when a check is made to ensure the user is not trying to access/modify/get a resource that belongs to another workspace.\r\n\r\n**Data Segregation**\r\njoola exposes a specific REST API endpoint at `query/fetch`, this enable users to consume data, but only from their workspace. A great concern would be a user managing to access data that belongs to another workspace, this will result in a data leakage.\r\n\r\n# YOUR TARGETS\r\nWe have setup a few options for you to test our software.\r\n\r\n**Install A Local Copy**\r\njoola is free, open source software. You can install a local copy of joola and test against it. It will give you the option to play around with the code and expand your attack vectors. Having a local copy also ensures you'll receive regular code updates, which are frequent.\r\n\r\n```bash\r\n$ git clone http://github.com/joola/joola\r\n$ git checkout develop\r\n```\r\nFor more details on setting up joola, please refer to the [setup guide](https://github.com/joola/joola/wiki/Setting-up-joola.io).\r\n\r\n**or Use our `develop` Heroku instance**\r\nIf you prefer testing an already running instance we have an heroku deployment available at https://joola-io-example.herokuapp.com. It supports both HTTP and HTTPs connections. Our Heroku instance will get updated on every successful build of the `develop` branch, meaning that fixes will be immediately available for evaluation following patches/fixes.\r\n\r\n**Security Tokens**\r\nTo make your life even easier, we have created two users you can play with either post local installation or on the Heroku instance. You can read more about security tokens on our [API documentation](http://docs.joolaio.apiary.io)\r\n\r\n*?APIToken=apitoken-demo* will grant you superuser permissions.\r\n*?APIToken=apitoken-test* will grant you limited permissions to the _test workspace.\r\n*?APIToken=apitoken-stats* will grant you limited permissions to the _stats workspace.\r\n\r\n# SIMPLE RULES\r\n- Responsibly disclose a previously unknown vulnerability directly to us.\r\n- When using our Heroku instance, please apply Fair Usage and avoid abuse of the Heroku service.\r\n- This vulnerability must significantly compromise the security of a typical joola installation.\r\n- Denial of Service and Social Engineering attacks are unlikely to qualify unless particularly clever.\r\n- Vulnerabilities on the OS/Provider level are out-of-scope.\r\n- Vulnerabilities in other bundled dependencies qualify if they affect a typical joola installation, but are less interesting than vulnerabilities in joola itself.\r\n\r\n# GETTING STARTED\r\n- You can find [the source](http://github.com/joola/joola) and start looking for vulnerabilities on GitHub.\r\n- If you want to get in touch with us to ask questions, you can always find us on [gitter](https://gitter.im/joola/joola).\r\n\r\n# RESPONSE TIMELINE\r\n\r\nWe will respond to reports within 24 hours.\r\nWe will fix security issues within 24 hours of confirming them.","policy_html":"\u003ch1 id=\"overview\"\u003eOVERVIEW\u003c/h1\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003ejoola is an \u003ca href=\"http://github.com/joola/joola\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\"\u003e\u003cspan\u003eopen source\u003c/span\u003e\u003ci class=\"icon-external-link\"\u003e\u003c/i\u003e\u003c/a\u003e data analytics and visualization framework that enable businesses to store data within its engine and later display the data securely in their websites using an advanced Javascript SDK.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003ejoola exposes a set of REST API endpoints responsible for every aspect of the framework, from data store, configuration changes to querying data out.

Мы просим вас об этом, потому что нам нужно иметь достаточное количество времени, чтобы ответить вам и исправить уязвимость.\r\n\r\nСообщение о том, что указанная вами уязвимость подтвердилась, а также информация о присуждении вам награды будут появляться в вашем багрепорте. Там же мы можем задать вам уточняющие вопросы или запросить дополнительную информацию, пожалуйста, следите за своим \"тикетом\". \r\n\r\nМинимальная награда за сообщение об уязвимости: $100, максимальный размер награды ограничен лишь критичностью уязвимости. Примерные размеры наград за критичные уязвимости:\r\n\r\n**Для auth.mail.ru**\r\n\r\nУдалённое выполнение  кода(RCE): $10000\r\nМанипуляции с файлами, чтение/запись(LFR, RFI, XXE): $5000 \r\nИнъекции(SQLi или эквивалент): $5000\r\nМежсайтовый скриптинг(XSS): $500 (кроме self-XSS)\r\nМежсайтовая подделка запросов(СSRF, Flash crossdomain requests): $150-500\r\n\r\n**Для проектов из scope**\r\n\r\nУдалённое выполнение  кода(RCE): $3000\r\nМанипуляции с файлами, чтение/запись(LFR, RFI, XXE): $2000 \r\nИнъекции(SQLi или эквивалент): $2000\r\nМежсайтовый скриптинг(XSS) на чтении письма через его содержимое: $1000\r\nМежсайтовый скриптинг(XSS): $500 (кроме self-XSS)\r\nМежсайтовая подделка запросов(СSRF, Flash crossdomain requests): $150-500(в зависимости от критичности)\r\n\r\nВыплаты производятся через систему проекта [HackerOne](https://hackerone.com/faq#bounties-how-do-i-get-paid).\r\n\r\n\r\nРаскрытие уязвимости\r\n=======================\r\nРаскрытие информации об уязвимости должно производится в соответствии с правилами HackerOne.\r\nЗапрос на раскрытие должен производиться через интерфейс репортов на HackerOne.\r\nДо раскрытия информации на HackerOne не допускается раскрытия информации на любых других ресурсах, в т.ч. частичное.\r\nЛюбая сенситивная информация, включая особенности инфраструктуры, реализации, внутренняя документация, интерфейсы и процедуры, исходный код, приватные данные пользователей и сотрудников; доступ к которой случайно был получен при демонстрации уязвимости не должна раскрываться. Намеренный доступ к указанной информации строго запрещен.","policy_html":"\u003cp\u003eРусскоязычное описание программы ниже.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003chr\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWe are announcing a month of double-pay for critical bugs in Mail.Ru e-mail service.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eUntil February, 1, we will pay double reward for the critical bugs.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eRemote code execution(RCE): $6000 (instead of usual $3000)\u003cbr\u003e\nLocal files access and manipulation(LFR, RFI, XXE): $4000 (instead of usual $2000)\u003cbr\u003e\nInjections(SQLi or equivalent): $4000 (instead of usual $2000)\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eAlso we are planning to reward $6000 for a server-side technical vulnerabilities that can give remote access to victim’s arbitrary email messages.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThis offer only covers new critical vulnerabilities in e-mail services submitted via HackerOne interface during promotion dates.

This would put a website at risk from an external attacker or a disgruntled editor with limited permissions. It is a clear documented attack that always grants access to someone who should not have it. This type of exploit would be considered a top priority and would likely force an immediate point release of the core to resolve. \r\n\r\n**External Attack Vector** - A bug that an external attacker might use in conjunction with other techniques to gain access or get data. No administrative access is required to exploit the bug. The bug does not provide access on its own. It would have to be part of a larger attack, often involving some social engineering. These are considered a high priority and are typically patched immediately by the core team in github and launched in the next version of the core. \r\n\r\n**Internal Attack Vector** - A bug that requires someone already have some type of administrative access to the CMS. This might just change the experience of the CMS, or be part of a more complicated attack that might hypothetically gain more access than they should have. These are considered important to clean up over time. \r\n\r\nResponse\r\n=======\r\n* We will try to respond to most reports within 48 hours.\r\n* We will fix ___open door___ security issues within 48 hours of confirming them, all other issues will be fixed within a reasonable timeline as determined after triage.\r\n* We've got some limited swag and lots of honor for those who submit issues related to the core software, but no cash. Generally we're sending out stickers, but occasionally a truly stellar report gets a t-shirt.\r\n","policy_html":"\u003cp\u003econcrete5 is a powerful CMS built around the idea of in-context editing.

Low-quality reports may be rewarded below these tiers, so please make sure that there is enough information for us to be able to reproduce your issue.  Step-by-step instructions including how to reproduce your issue starting out by creating a fresh Slack account are preferred.  Screenshots and videos are also helpful, but please make sure to not make these public before submitting them to follow our program’s rules.  \r\n\r\nThere is no maximum reward - particularly creative or severe bugs will be rewarded accordingly.

See our post on [Tumblr](https://yahoo-security.tumblr.com/post/136619322000/taking-our-bug-bounty-program-to-the-next-level) for the official announcement.\r\n\r\nReported bugs will be assessed by our security team to determine if they qualify for a reward. Please report a potential security issue immediately. Yahoo will consider the impact to the company and our users and will calculate the reward accordingly. Bug submissions will be reviewed within 30 days.\r\n\r\nReporting\r\n------------------\r\n**Verifiable proof the vulnerability exists (screenshot/video/script) is required to receive an award**\r\n\r\nFor more technically elaborate vulnerabilities, reproduction steps are required. If our security team cannot reproduce and verify an issue, a bounty cannot be awarded. When submitting a bug, please also keep in mind the following:\r\n\r\n- Use test accounts so as not to inadvertently compromise the privacy of our users\r\n- Minimize the mayhem. For instance, when testing for a command injection vulnerability, it is sufficient to show the output of the *id* or *hostname* commands. It is not necessary to *cat /etc/passwd.* When attempting to demonstrate root permissions with the following primitives in a vulnerable process please use the following commands:\r\n  - **Read:** *cat /proc/1/maps*\r\n  - **Write:** *touch /root/\\\u003cyour H1 username\\\u003e*\r\n  - **Execute:** *id*\r\n\r\nA good bug report should include the following information at a minimum:\r\n+ List the URL and any affected parameters\r\n+ Describe the browser, OS, and/or app version\r\n+ Describe the perceived impact. How could the bug *potentially* be exploited?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIn-Scope Domains and Properties\r\n------------------\r\nThe scope of this program is limited to technical security vulnerabilities on Yahoo owned applications. For password and account access issues please work with our [Customer Care team](https://help.yahoo.com/kb/helpcentral). \r\n- *.yahoo.com\r\n- *.flickr.com\r\n- All Yahoo and Flickr branded mobile apps\r\n- All Yahoo and Flickr branded client side applications\r\n- Brightroll\r\n- Flurry\r\n- Media Group One\r\n- Polyvore\r\n- Yahoo Small Business (aabaco and luminate domains)\r\n\r\nOut-of-Scope Domains and Properties\r\n------------------\r\n- *.yahoo.net\r\n- Yahoo 7 (au.yahoo.com/nz.yahoo.com)\r\n- Yahoo Japan (Contact: yird-contact@mail.yahoo.co.jp)\r\n- [Tumblr](https://www.tumblr.com/docs/en/bug_bounty)\r\n- Onwander\r\n- Rivals\r\n- Yahoo operated Wordpress blogs\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFindings not eligible for bounty\r\n------------------\r\n- Vulnerabilities affecting users of outdated browsers or platforms\r\n  - IE \u003c 9\r\n  - Chrome \u003c 40\r\n  - Firefox \u003c 35\r\n  - Safari \u003c 7\r\n  - Opera \u003c 13\r\n- \"Self\" XSS\r\n- Open redirects\r\n- Missing cookie flags\r\n- SSL/TLS best practices\r\n- Information disclosures\r\n- Mixed content warnings\r\n- Denial of Service attacks\r\n- \"HTTP Host Header\" XSS\r\n- Clickjacking/UI redressing\r\n- Missing crumb parameters\r\n- Software version disclosure\r\n- Account/e-mail enumeration\r\n- Reflected file download attacks\r\n- Incomplete or missing SPF/DKIM\r\n- Physical or social engineering attacks\r\n- Results of automated tools or scanners\r\n- Login/logout/unauthenticated/low-impact CSRF\r\n- Presence of autocomplete attribute on web forms\r\n- Using unreported vulnerabilities to find other bugs\r\n- Query manipulation that exposes tables or info via YQL\r\n- Self-exploitation (i.e. password reset links or cookie reuse)\r\n- Issues related to networking protocols or industry standards\r\n- XSS in Flash files not developed by Yahoo, e.g. third-party ads\r\n- Use of a known-vulnerable library (without proof of exploitability)\r\n- Descriptive/verbose/unique error pages (without proof of exploitability)\r\n- Any Yahoo-developed software that is End of Life or no longer supported\r\n- Any non-Yahoo applications, unless it's a Yahoo modified or branded version\r\n- Missing security-related HTTP headers which do not lead directly to a vulnerability\r\n- Internal pivoting, scanning, exploiting, or exfiltrating data from internal Yahoo systems\r\n\r\n\f\r\nEligibility and Coordinated Disclosure\r\n------------------\r\nYou will be eligible for a bounty only if you are the first person to disclose an unknown issue to Yahoo. The Yahoo security team and associated development teams have 30 days to respond to the report, and up to 90 days to implement a fix based on the severity of the report. Please allow for this process to fully complete before you publicly disclose the vulnerability. Note that posting details or conversations about this report before it has been approved for disclosure or posting details that reflect badly on this program and the Yahoo brand will result in forfeiture of any award and/or immediate removal from the program.\r\n\r\n\r\nRewards\r\n------------------\r\nQualifying bugs will be rewarded based on severity, to be determined by the Yahoo security team. Rewards may range from Yahoo-branded swag to monetary rewards up to $15,000 USD. Awards are granted entirely at the discretion of Yahoo.\r\n\r\nAt Yahoo's discretion, providing more complete research, proof-of-concept code and detailed writeups may incur a bonus percentage on the bounty awarded. Conversely, Yahoo may pay less for vulnerabilities that require complex or over-complicated interactions or for which the impact or security risk is negligible.  \r\n\r\nIn some cases, rewards may be consolidated into a single payout. For example, multiple reports of the same vulnerability across different parameters of a resource, or demonstrations of multiple attack vectors against a fundamental framework issue.\r\n\r\nRewards may be reduced or declined if there is evidence of abuse, such as data exfiltration or withholding reports in order to chain multiple issues together.\r\n\r\n\r\nLegal\r\n------------------\r\nIn connection with your participation in this program you agree to comply with all applicable local and national laws.\r\n\r\nYahoo reserves the right to change or modify the terms of this program at any time.\r\n\r\nYou may not participate in this program if you are a resident or individual located within a country appearing on any U.S. sanctions lists.\r\n\r\nVulnerabilities obtained by exploiting Yahoo users or employees are not eligible for a bounty and will result in immediate disqualification from the program.\r\n\r\nYahoo has never given permission/authorization (either implied or explicit) to an individual or group of individuals to extract personal information or content of Yahoo users and publicize this information on the open, public-facing Internet without user consent, nor has Yahoo ever given permission for programs or data belonging to Yahoo to be modified or corrupted in order to extract and publicly disclose data belonging to Yahoo.\r\n\r\nYahoo employees and contingent workers, as well as their immediate family members and persons living in the same household, are not eligible to receive bounties or rewards of any kind under the Yahoo Bug Bounty Program, whether hosted by Yahoo or any third party.\r\n\r\n\r\n#Example Report\r\n\r\n###Title\r\nReflected XSS in www.inscopedomain.yahoo.com/payment\r\n\r\n###Issue Information\r\nThe *global_notice* parameter on the */payment* page is vulnerable to reflected cross-site scripting. \r\n\r\nThe *global_notice* parameter contains error message information that is interpreted and displayed to the user by their browser. To provide additional context for users, the â€œparamsâ€ portion of this serialized object can contain additional string or numerical data. By HTML-encoding a script tag, it is possible to inject content into the page:\r\n\r\na:1:{{s:5:\"errno\";i:1;s:3:\"params\";a:1:{i:0;s:39:\"\u0026#x3c;script\u0026#x3e;alert\u0026#x28;document\u0026#x2e;cookie\u0026#x29;\u0026#x3c;/script\u0026#x3e;\";}}}\r\n\r\n\r\nTo **reproduce** this vulnerability, click this link once logged in to the application:\r\n\r\n    https://inscopedomain.yahoo.com/payment?crumb=AABBCcddeeF\u0026global_notice=a%3A1%3A%7B%7Bs%3A5%3A%22errno%22%3Bi%3A1%3Bs%3A3%3A%22params%22%3Ba%3A1%3A%7Bi%3A0%3Bs%3A39%3A%22%26%23%783c%3bscript%26%23%783e%3balert%26%23%78%32%38%3bdocument%26%23%78%32%65%3bcookie%26%23%78%32%39%3b%26%23%783c%3b%2fscript%26%23%783e%3b%22%3B%7D%7D%7D\r\n\r\nThe **impact** of this vulnerability is variable, depending on how it is used. An attacker could use this vulnerability to target a specific victim or post it in a popular forum frequented by users of this application. If an authenticated Yahoo user could be tricked into clicking the link it may result in malicious JavaScript executing in the context of the user's session and could result in credential/session theft, disclosure of sensitive information or other targeted attacks. This could result in multiple compromised accounts and theft of user-data and consequently, negative publicity and reputation damage to Yahoo. \r\n\r\nThis issue was discovered and verified on OSX 10.9 using Chrome 46 and Firefox 42.\r\n\r\nTo **mitigate** this vulnerability, consider the following:\r\n- Consider scaling back some features of the serialized object such that all that is returned is an error code.

However, we recognize that we will not be the most effective avenue in all circumstances. We will gladly consider rewards for vulnerabilities that have been publicly disclosed through some other means, provided they adhered to our disclosure guidelines.\r\n\r\nIt's important to keep in mind that not all submissions will qualify for a bounty.

You **must not** send us the details of the vulnerability until it has been validated, accepted, and publicly disclosed by the project maintainers.\r\n\r\nWhen should you report to security@python.org?\r\n==============================================\r\n\r\nDepending on the risk of the issue, sometimes security@python.org might not be the best channel to report it.\r\n\r\nThe risk level is often determined by a product of the impact once exploited, and the probability of exploitation occurring. In other words, if a bug can cause great damage, but it takes highest privilege to exploit the bug, then the bug is not a high risk one. Similarly, if the bug is easily exploitable, but its impact is limited, then it is not a high risk issue either.\r\n\r\nThere is not any hard and fast rule to determine if a bug is worth reporting. The general rule is any attack worth reporting via the security address must allow an attacker to affect the confidentiality, integrity and availability of the Python application or its system for which the attacker does not already have the capability.\r\n\r\nTo illustrate the point, here are some examples of past issues and what the Python Security Response Team (PSRT) thinks of them. When in doubt, however, please do send us a report nonetheless. If the responder can't find any relevant exploitable code, the report may be re-posted publicly.\r\n\r\nPublic disclosure preferred\r\n-------------------------------\r\n\r\nIn [issue \\#27863](http://bugs.python.org/issue27863), several problems such as use-after-free, and out-of-bound memory access in module `elementtree` were reported. However, the exploit cannot be provoked by providing it with XML data.  It requires that the attacker be able to provoke the execution of the `__getstate__` method, which is something an attacker would only be able to do if they had the ability to execute arbitrary Python code, or, if they could somehow coerce the application to pickle an XML tree.  Neither of these are generally possible from an unprivileged position.\r\n\r\n[Issue \\#272829](http://bugs.python.org/issue27773) is a double-free bug in a highly critical builtin module `ssl`. However, the bug requires an attacker who can cause `PyWeakref_NewRef` to fail, which means the ability to deterministically exhaust memory at a specific point in C code execution.\r\n\r\nWhile these are clearly important bugs to fix, and may, in some hypothetical situations, have a security impact, the only proof of concept the PSRT can imagine for any of them is to be able to execute arbitrary Python code.  If you can already execute Python code, there are far worse things you can do than provoke a use-after-free or an interpreter crash.\r\n\r\nPrivate disclosure preferred\r\n-------------------------------\r\n\r\n[Issue \\#7673](http://bugs.python.org/issue7673) is a security vulnerability that affect an obscure corner of the standard library but it is appropriate to disclose privately, because the APIs that it affects are ones designed to handle untrusted data, something that an attacker could plausibly get a Python program to consume with the expectation that it would be safe.\r\n\r\n[Issue \\#17239](http://bugs.python.org/issue17239)  and [\\#24238](http://bugs.python.org/issue24238) are similar security vulnerabilities affecting multiple popular builtin modules such as `expat` and `elementtree`.  They allow an attacker to render a Python application unavailable by feeding it malicious XML data.\r\n\r\nThe common theme of these vulnerabilities is they let the attacker *escalate* privilege from unprivileged position.  *Arbitrary python code execution* is the highest level of privilege possible in the python interpreter.  There are other modules (such as `marshal`) which explicitly say that all data must be taken from only trusted sources (and hence privileged).\r\n","policy_html":"\u003cp\u003eThe Internet Bug Bounty Panel is awarding bounties for critical security vulnerabilities in popular, open source programming languages.

Even so, we believe that all technology contains bugs and that the public plays a crucial role in identifying these bugs. If you believe you've found a security bug in our service, we'll gladly work with you to resolve that issue and ensure you are fairly compensated for your discovery.\r\n\r\n### If you are looking to report a non-security-related bug in HackerOne, please [submit here](https://support.hackerone.com/hc/en-us/requests/new) instead. \r\n\r\nWe categorize security bugs in our service into two categories:\r\n\r\n* **Severe**: Any bug that might grant unauthorized access to confidential bug descriptions. Severe bugs have a minimum bounty of **$10,000**.\r\n* **Interesting**: Any bug that might otherwise potentially impact the security of our service. Interesting bugs have a minimum bounty of **$500**.\r\n\r\nWe believe in transparency about our security, so any valid vulnerabilities discovered are always publicly disclosed once confirmed and resolved.\r\n\r\nBelow we'll describe some of the measures we take to keep our service safe and secure.\r\n\r\nApplication Security\r\n===============\r\n\r\n* Several of our engineers live double lives as security engineers and penetration testers. All commits go through mandatory code and security review, along with examination by static analysis tools.\r\n* All data access and mutation goes through a stringent Command Query Responsibility Segregation (CQRS) framework for centralized auditing, authentication, and authorization.\r\n* This framework utilizes strong typing and parameterization to eliminate SQL Injection attacks, as well as enforcing the presence of an anti-CSRF token prior to any data mutation.\r\n* We utilize a strict [Content Security Policy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Content_Security_Policy) and a safe-by-default templating language to effectively neutralize Cross-Site Scripting (XSS).\r\n* We encrypt all network communications with SSL/TLS accompanied with [Perfect Forward Secrecy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forward_secrecy#Perfect_Forward_Secrecy) and [HTTP Strict Transport Security (HSTS)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTP_Strict_Transport_Security), including being [HSTS preloaded](https://hstspreload.appspot.com/) in most major browsers.\r\n* All requests pass through multiple rate limiting implementations to protect against brute-force attacks.\r\n* We don't store passwords: we store `bcrypt(13, salt, strcat(password, sha512(app-token, env-token)))`.\r\n* Passwords must be a minimum of 8 characters and pass a [zxcvbn](https://blogs.dropbox.com/tech/2012/04/zxcvbn-realistic-password-strength-estimation/) strong entropy check.\r\n* User-submitted content (such as attachments and images) is stored in AWS S3, encrypted at rest, and served from a sandboxed domain, protecting from [Same-origin Policy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Same-origin_policy) attacks.\r\n* Two-factor authentication and IP whitelisting are available to further restrict access to accounts.\r\n* Role-based access control allows for granular permissions for team members.\r\n* No credit card information is stored on our servers.

This is not a competition and only one reward per security bug will be awarded.\r\n\r\nFor reports that demonstrate PHI exposure from outside of the owner's account (does not require malicious staff), we will award a minimum of $200.
